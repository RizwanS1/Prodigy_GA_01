ROMEO:
Hath he, my lord?

BUCKINGHAM:
No, gracious lord, no; if he serve God, let him serve;
No, no, with oath, but by God.

GLOUCESTER:
You will take exceptions to you:
No, gracious lord, except you have;
But you will take exceptions to you.

BUCKINGHAM:
No, gracious lord, except I cannot do it.

GLOUCESTER:
And you, my lord, will bear the time.

BUCKINGHAM:
How now, my lord? what hap?

GLOUCESTER:
Yonder is the day we were at Mantua.

BUCKINGHAM:
And the day we were at Mantua,
Where the noble duke is become.

LADY GREY:
I' faith, I'll keep you company.

GLOUCESTER:
I go before you take the time;
And
====================
ROMEO:
Give me thy hand:
A little while will prompt my tongue.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
A little while, Kate; the very minute of
My gossips youth in his pilgrimage.

DUCHESS:
A glooming peace this morning, thy sovereign,
To curt thy wandering eyes, thy wanton love,
To see thy tas with a lusty wit;
Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted
And, with that, I thank God, the gods, and the years,
That thou, whose gratitude and right Christian soul,
Towards thy being proud? O, the kindest virtue!
And, to be thy comforts, thy wanton'st rest!
That thou, which was worthily buy'd
And now in sell by the dead of darkness,
Is now as neuter. Adieu,
Your son shall do well: farewell;
His son shall buy out a new world of crowns;
And then in Mantua there will be order ta'en revenge;
For then this
====================
ROMEO:
I would to God that hath beheld the prince:
I'll pray you, tell me what I shall, that you have
Such grace for grace and mercy.

GLOUCESTER:
Peace, wilful villain,
That feed upon one wretched branch of root,
To season love, that feed on one root,
This root was not the prince; I say you have a note.

LADY CAPULET:
You take my leave, and I'll not trouble you.

GLOUCESTER:
No, madam, girl; you must not stay.

LADY CAPULET:
You take my leave before I take my horse.

GLOUCESTER:
Nay, come, you, you ancient stones, and you
Must walk in the island, the jewels that you must use me.

LADY CAPULET:
You must go to the monument,
To find the monument where he is.

GLOUCESTER:
There shall no

ROMEO:
Nay, come, poor soul, awake.

PETRUCHIO:
Do you hear, sir? To leave frivolous circumstances,
I wish you were but idly curst.

KATHARINA:
Yet you will not, sir.

PETRUCHIO:
Did you perceive me in the world so well as I do?

PETRUCHIO:
Marry, you are.

PETRUCHIO:
I did. What, good old hat?

PETRUCHIO:
Now, Kate, in thy green and springing,
The daintiest Kate in Christendom
Kate of Kate Hall, my super-school-master,
The duke's name is Kate of curst-bush;
That doth a mean-wink'd duke,
And Kate of Kate Hall, and himself,
Even in the downfall of his mellow'd years,
As Kate in his former state.

PETRUCHIO:
Sister

ROMEO:
My lord!
You must have leave to speak.

BUCKINGHAM:
No, my lord; I'll try this widow's wit.

BUCKINGHAM:
Now I would it were not--

LUCKINGHAM:
'Tis now in my head, as I hear, she will still remain.

GLOUCESTER:
I swear, in all despite of all the rest.

BUCKINGHAM:
Then, Warwick, shouldst not first uncles should
But, as they say, all were with false
That Richard their king was in the former state.

GLOUCESTER:
Then, Warwick, in despite of all that;
Which, after time, succeeding ages have re-ed
A shepherdlike offer to displace me in the Tower,
To sit my coronation.

BUCKINGHAM:
I do not love the king so well as I love myself.

GLOUCESTER:
But I do not love the king
====================
ROMEO:
So would you be again.

ESCALUS:
As full of valour as of valour!

ANGELO:
Tut, so would you be again:
And yet let me be a slave;
I cannot name thee.

ESCALUS:
More than you deserve;
But that as you deserve; and that shall find you
With such a weighty cause as is the duke's,
Whose credit will bear your knave by the sword,
And pluck your sword out o' the villain's throat.

ANGELO:
Away! the duke would have his last attempt.

ESCALUS:
I would not do't: for he hath evermore miss'd
The lands of Rome.

ANGELO:
Well, well, let him do't.

ESCALUS:
I shall do't: he shall find you both.

ANGELO:
The duke hath sworn his coming is

ROMEO:

A very weak and foolish.

Am I such a fellow?

Nurse:
Am I such a fellow?

JULIET:
Well, well, let me be a fellow:
And yet you are passing courteous, no,
I would not be married; I shall be married;
Let me be a-dame; let me be a-bed;
And therefore have no wife.
You have a mad-coun'd fool to Lady Lucy!
You have put me in thy mind: well, madam, adieu.
What says the other troop?

MARCIUS:
They are dissolved: hang 'em! They do disdain,
They'll take some occasion of offence.
They're not to keep a longer form, but to die.

Nurse:
How can you reconcile me?

MARCIUS:
I cannot make my wounds to flow.

ROMEO:
I say, I have; but you shall have a cause to seek
Ere I do look on.

MENENIUS:
Fie on't! what noise did you speak?

COMINIUS:
As noise as a sea; and as they knock
Upon the curl'd clouds, so I did not push
The gods to my strong bidding task. But, beseech you,
Most willingly humbly and your noble self,
What you most affect, is yours, and all beside,
To whom you are most constant; unless you be
An honourable-trick.

MENENIUS:
Why, what is your name?

COMINIUS:
Lucentio, gentle sir.

MENENIUS:
Happily we met; the happier for thy son.

COMINIUS:
'Tis more pertinent for a name than tongue can name thee,
Though you are to be something rare and were it were;
As is the coal, the sun, and

ROMEO:
Thou art sworn to lolling stones,
No, no, no, nor no, not a whit;
But yet a very weakling, as it were far off,
And, as it were far off, or at all
Uncertain way to venge my laid.

LEONTES:
How now, Paulina!

PAULINA:
I am in love with you.
What, has your queen married the other?
How does your precious brother? are you sure of
A? shall we on without giving you?
Go together, or take hands:
You are married to and holy.

LEONTES:
What, are you sure of this, Pompey? What, with
a crutch'd your brother? 'tis not much:
We are blest our chastity, for
His sacred chastity.

And,--

To go with us unto the officers

ROMEO:
I'll see thee to Padua, there to visit
A son of mine own.

TRANIO:
What is his name?

BIONDELLO:
Lucentio.

TRANIO:
Happily we met; the happier for thy son.
Upon my head, that report'st thou,
Though she,My wife, thy son, was strucken on thee,
His lands then seized on by the conqueror:
And thou mine, which being answer'd,
Have I by my fault,--Happily I now reprieve thee,
Though I with death and with thy love's heavy heart
Dabbling with my love's cousin's hate,
Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others' love,
Thy love did hate upon thee.

TRANIO:
Thou detestable slave, for, as thou art,
It had upon its services.

Which didst unworthy

ROMEO:
I came to Padua, there to visit
A son of mine, which long I have not seen.

PETRUCHIO:
What, you say? To enter in, and there repose,
A goodly city.

GREGREGORY:
But, as the unthought-on; lastly,
A wise stoutness to enter in, and have
Some great leisure to entertain
Such friends as time in Padua shall be wife.

PETRUCHIO:
Would you not go?

GREGORY:
I told you your son was well beloved in Padua.

PETRUCHIO:
Sir, you hear me this sentence of mine own life,
And then let me tell thee tales.

PETRUCHIO:
Of love?

PETRUCHIO:
Of either, madam:
That Petruchio came in Padua
To Padua, there to visit to behold
Thy noble gentleman.

My gracious lord,--

MERCUTIO:
Sister, give us better credit:
That we have always truly served you, sir,
Till we have had you before Corioli and made you
Without giving you to gratulate your worship, and given
A gratatitude to the gaol.

PETRUCHIO:
I shall be Vincentio of Pisa;
That shall I come at Padua's Castle.

BAPTISTA:

To keep me from danger, keep me from danger;
If you are noble, mild sir, and affable,

With all good speed at Plashy visit you.

My lord, I'll tell you what: what think you?

Nurse:
Your mother is a very caitiff Roman;
She doth with no warrant of a man.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, then you are not in arms.

Nurse:
You have, my lord: a lady's wife is
courteous; and she comes
courteous.

PETRUCHIO:
Peace, I have; and, God be thank'd, good gentlewoman,
I am affianced this afternoon, and I am
courteous; and, I am sure, in heart, and, I am
courteous; and I am jealous. Let this be
fied, Kate: and let me go:
Let this be the day; let this be the
day, the 'day; let this be the day; let this be the
day; let this be the noon: I'll swear this,
on some day some time.

Very well.
Hath not a grain of it is
The doting in a word?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
No, sir; a very little.

ROMEO:
I weigh it lightly,
And, like a mighty thunder
Upon the curl'd clouds, that the two parts
Of that arch-enemy earth, the prince, King of Wales,
With clog of conscience and sour melancholy,
Hath turn'd his visage from his unreverent shoulders.

Well, well, he disdains to shine; for his eye
Hath not the separated councils, nor his intents

Where foxes, geese, fawning, flatterers,--
That feed upon a barren mountain and still wintering,
Do bear the rest, who with your tithe-tack'd hat,
Which, whiles lions, that dreadful boughs, bear her light,
To have her tongue unwholesome, to shape your boys
As they laugh at me, with your kindest hate,

When dreadful war devour this earth, the earth's good haught
To thee, the heaven, that hath nothing else.

BRAKENBURY:
An he had been cannib,
he would have slain a maid: let him fly:
An he did snatch his holy heart

The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.

To have them recompensed as I please:
If I do lose your honour,
Then I shall have mine honour to do it.

You are to blame, and go about it.

I mean, to get your husband's lands.

ROMEO:
What, I'll do: but do the errand,
To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
My noble lord, I'll watch you from this church;
And, if you, my lord, bid it go.
The watch is coming; be wary, look about.
You, sirrah, look about the churchyard:
Go on the right hand, for this time,
We three will walk. There's other of you have beheld
What hath been beholding to this churchyard: I am a Christian;
And then I will watch you from such watching now.
What, ho! who calls so hard?

His deputy anointed in His sight,
Hath caused his death: the which if wrongfully,
Let heaven revenge; for wrong, in God's name,
Our justice, for that which may never have
A royal angelical power, may it not be a mourner,
With what foul matter he died to Rome,
His body couched in the blood of his banish'd hands
With curses in the worthy blood, his arm
To rust upon our condemned souls, his body,
His head, his body, his arm, thy thy lawful king;
Or, with that hand, that hand, thy mortal body,
Without control, listed to make his prey.

And therein your noble gentleman gave you out
Unto the service of his lands.

The bridegroom shall be to-night; the bridegroom
That shall be the best: and let her be
A dram of work, to wash him off, that kill your joys,
The King of heaven finds but piddling.
Hast thou not crossed me, Kate, I have cross'd her,
To kill her double-favour'd joys with thee?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I'll have no halves; the duke
Is grown somewhat unfashionable. Stand all apart,
And have forsworn you with a double occasion of woe;
For, look you, one cannot tell how to hate a thought
Of what we wildly do, but that to cross our country,
Because they are friends with us two well-verent,
And that your brothers beat the country's breast,
Because they bear the shapes of men.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I fear no separated councils, no such friends nor friends.

How do you? To leave frivolous circumstances,
To have a father, wife, and a wife!

LADY CAPULET:
You are too blunt: too like a fool,
Though you are a devil, yet sweet as spring-time,
To go with you to the lamb.

JULIET:
I am too mean a subject for myself:
I speak not like a lamb, but temperate as the dove;
And yet I cannot go with you to the bear.

Nurse:
You shall go: your brother's blood is well hit in you.

The best is, when you are gentle.

Well, well, well, well, you are no lamb.

Well, I may not swear I love thy bed-bed liege,
But to my sweet love's love,--
And, if you will not, be sure,

As those in Rome litter'd:
The young prince hath sworn his coming is

And, for his confirmation, the brat is
To be her own; your temple then next degree,
To be her men, wives, or poor children,
May walk abroad; I'll not

As you are cloudy to sleep so do,
You have no cause to gird at such a silly time.
If God forgive me, God shall pardon me.

Have I a glass of sorrow and melancholy
To make a leg, a little scene
To entertain woe, sorrow, in sorrow's grave.

I know thee not, man, nor woman:
These English woes shall not be my sorrow;
For curses received, upon pain of life,
Have had a taste of what I fear
Of death that did the edict infringe
And the unnoting of the duke.

It may be determined at the one.

And, in the last, to have the vengeance for it,
Of this young prince, my noble lord, whom

They vented their complainings; which, indeed,
On Thursday next degree, shall be to Tybalt's wife.

Of Juliet and her allies, as they guess,
Your gracious self to resolve your stomachs.

I am too young; and fearfully, I pray you,
To see your stomachs every day.

LUCIO:
You shall have no cause to save a son of mine;
And you shall have one too much: fare you well, good father.
There is the pleasure ta'en for thy advice:
And, look you, sir, when I am here, I do not use to jest.

PETRUCHIO:
I shall be Vincentio of Pisa; let me go:
And, if you be, sir, be your fellow.

PETRUCHIO:
No, sir, you shall not be my fellow.
You shall be my steady, nay, and marry her.

====================
ROMEO:
I am the greatest cause.

Provost:
Who shall command your highness to do it?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
That you command.

Provost:
Madam, we'll make all speed.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You will go with us unto your father's house.

Provost:
You will find me much of your parish;
And, I know, you shall find me well.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You will go with us unto the morning morning's prompt;
And there she shall find me well.

Provost:
But shall you go with me?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No, sir, I'll do it upon a day's journey.

Provost:
You shall find me apt enough to take my leave.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Didst perceive it?
'Tis sin to flatter; 'Be patient, grant
====================
ROMEO:
Tut, thou art deceived, for thou art not honest.

HORTENSIO:
Well, I am, no maid: 'tis a maid:
Your maids are made to be but maids;
And women are made to be.

TRANIO:
If she be curst, you need not put
The ditty's nose, but Kate the curst,
She must be curst in company.

BIANCA:
Nay, be you contented:
Did you perceive that she doth limp?

TRANIO:
I did; but with words, my master.

BIANCA:
Ay, and you; and saw her run after a gilded
Upon the green-sward!

TRANIO:
Golden Apollo, that hath aspired the sun
Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath
To grating earth's cold and dost not thy love
To feed upon this fair ground, scarce of purer love
To feed on this fair
====================
ROMEO:
I was in this business: your good company,
I do look you, sir; here is your brother's wife,
One that you love.

JULIET:
Indeed, you are no surer: you are not surer,
I do beseech you, and therefore have patience.

Nurse:
Your brother is grown into some trusty cause,
Suddenly taken; his wife for a while,
He may look on the new-made bride.

JULIET:
I beseech you, sir, he may not look for a day.

Nurse:
Are you sure of this?

JULIET:
No, sir, God forbid; but do not swear,
To look into the marriedry:
And, if you cannot, best you stop your knees.

JULIET:
And God forbid my lord, I beseech you, look to it.

Nurse:
I swear to you, sir, if you will hear me speak

ROMEO:
Yours, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Away, foolish woman! wife, as cold a lamb.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
By the affection that I dearly love thee,
So doth my love to thee.

ESCALUS:
That love's a lamb, that love's shadows.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Find it thee not?

ESCALUS:
Ay, as an ass, as a bear.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Did ever Dian so become a grove
As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?
Now, afore God, tell me, do not push me;
For, as you know me, my lord, she will not push me here,
But sit her own rates, for her recovery.

ESCALUS:
Is this your speeding? nay, then indeed she will push on others.

DUKE VINCENTIO:

ROMEO:
'Tis pity to wear this ring.

GLOUCESTER:
Lady, you know no rules of charity,
Which renders good for curses.

But I am none beast of back, and therefore am no beast.

The night's o'clock; I'll sup betide.

LADY CAPULET:
Good night!

ESCALUS:
What, do you? You'll sup with me.

JULIET:
What, do you? You'll sup with me?
Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise.

ESCALUS:
Let me go. The time and you shall come.
You that durst swear to your worship and your
t deliverance, do not swear at all;
For, sirrah, I'll not go: you shall not go to-day,
Or, if you find me out there.

LADY CAPULET:
Fie! it cannot be. You, sirrah, give us go.
Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise
Our executioner.

ANGELO:
I'll try how you can
====================
ROMEO:
'Tis a great natural, you might have heard me say:
Hence will you go; I think there's one.

ROMEO:
I swear I will not go:
But hear me, young waverer, come back again,
To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
Or, with Saint Peter, go with Paris.

JULIET:
Bid me farewell, sweet saint, for I have done
To holy palmers' bosoms!
What, shall I go unto this man?
The last leave we have to give thee,
And threatened death with scann'd Mercutio's death?
The last leave we have to give thee is
An ill-term'd excuse to the world.

ROMEO:
Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
Some patient leisure to excuse myself.

JULIET:
Fouler than tongue can think thee, thou canst make
No excuse current, but to hang thy heart.

I know the reason of that:

To God's good cause! I say unto thee,
From thy good cause, that thou dost love thy love.

DUCHESS:
God's good cause! What shall's that?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
A king, in God's name, and the king's, and I guess not.

DUCHESS:
If I be King of England, King Edward's.

KING EDWARD IV:
What, dukedom? for surely: but a God of heaven,
That King Edward is a worthy king.

DUCHESS:
No, gracious lord, but that you have broken in
The stones of the king; and, indeed,
Whom God defend against God's cause.

KING EDWARD IV:
Then Edward at Saint Alban's field,
Is likely to fall in by war,
Or by mis mis

You shall have the place, where you shall have it so.

ISABELLA:
You shall have the place; you shall have it so.

ANGELO:
'Tis well.

ISABELLA:
I'll carry you hence to the lane's end:
You shall have no cause to go with me:
Come, you shall go with me to the lane's end;
You shall go with me to the lane's end; your friends,
You shall be welcome with you.

ANGELO:
Did not you hear me swear at this place?

ISABELLA:
I shall, my lord.

ANGELO:
And you shall.

ISABELLA:
And still 'twixt me and me; for then
You shall be welcome with me.


====================
ROMEO:
And you will find me apt enough to be
executioner, though she have discretion.

ABRAHAM:
No, madam; yet you shall be king.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Henry shall be my king.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
Let him be, king of Pisa; let him be
His executioner, for he hath not that honourable
To the common distribution, but that he so leaves
His executioner.

ABRAHAM:
Sir, if you pardon me, king of Pisa;
Which long I have known to you, and your meed,
You shall be my comforter.
What shall I do?

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
A messenger from Mantua, with my letter in Padua.

GREMIO:
Where then, Thomas Earl of Pisa? you will not go?

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
Where then, sir? here in Padua.

ROMEO:
Wherefore should this be prevented?

Here, this same monument.

JULIET:

Nurse:
Go hence, and from all post to the monument.

LADY CAPULET:
'Tis not to,, but to: go, and wash;
For thou shalt know, is it your way to chide.
There is differency between our hours;
And then look back with a gracious eye:
First, here's one: go, poor soul,
And then look back, and do not mind the play.

Nurse:
Why, here's the door; be gone.

CLAUDIO:
Here in the prison.

ISABELLA:
Why, here she died her brother.

CLAUDIO:
Now, brother, pardon me in what you did;
And call you hither, Kate to your sister;
The duke, that mocks at your discords too,
Hath been beyond account, and now, I hear,
You should account me, in what?

ISABELLA:
To God I spake my sister;
I will in time to clear them.

CLAUDIO:
Now, sister, what cheer? in your drift?

ISABELLA:
What hast thou done?

CLAUDIO:
I brought my brother's pardon;
Thou spake not the jollownessenger, but he
Hast no other sin at all, but the effect
Of kinder misfortune: I in justice cannot
Relear that I am lost.

ROMEO:
No, gracious lord.

GLOUCESTER:
I wish you, sir.

LADY ANNE:
No, sir.

GLOUCESTER:
But you shall guess.

That shall assure my constant loyalty.

Now, by Saint Paul, this princely gift of hell,
Which thou shalt assure my constant loyalty.

GLOUCESTER:
And, by Saint Paul, this wearers,
Our greatest friend, and thy complices,
To him we pardon.

LADY ANNE:
Right, princely gift of such a weight:
Before thy coming, I'll give thee more:

Whose deadly web ensnareth, that time would not use it.

I will be gone.

Nay, come, go, Kate: I'll try this widow's wit.

PETRUCHIO:
I know she taketh most delight.

PETRUCHIO:
And, honest Kate, tell me, Kate, what happy gale
Can you assure her?

PETRUCHIO:
Of a worthy choice.

PETRUCHIO:
Of a worthy choice! Let's go.

PETRUCHIO:
A gracious choice! and that's the top of that.

PETRUCHIO:
A crack, Kate?

PETRUCHIO:
I am sorry, old chafe, and wilt thou not take it.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, sir, you are not to blame, and you have
done it.

The poorest service is repaid with thanks;
And so shall mine, before you touch the hair.

GREMIO:
I thank you, sir.

And, to you'ld think, if you pardon me.

PETRUCHIO:
Clessing, mistress minion, for you know not.

PETRUCHIO:
No, sir, you mean not.

HORTENSIO:
I will be none of you; and you worse hope,
That you have been a fool and then vainly put on.

PETRUCHIO:
I fear me, sir, you shall have one too,
That shall be my wife; I'll swear upon her.

A sickly, desperate, but temperate, as I live.

I do suspect I have done some offence
That seems disgracious of the king my brother.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, he's a lamb, a dove, a very bear.

Provost:
Is't lawful too?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not, sir, a lamb, but a very weak and as it be;
The which is the top of you the fox,
Whose topmost lions keep you in awe,
Are you the top? Be gone, away!
You'll sup betimes, that you take in what you mean:
Play the mouse, the constable.
More you must do, but do the fool.
Hath been my wife, and how now!
O, that you were not wife? What will you adventure
With her whom you broke into your grove
And who here you did stay her still?

You shall, my lord.

And you, my lord.

My lord, at Saint Alban's field I'll enter in,
And there my man take up my holy order,
To enter in holy wedlock bands.
And, by Saint George, lead me thence;

To fight with Richard that span in this wide-chrechard wall,
And there I am well arm'd.

KING EDWARD IV:
The duke sends to your majesty.

NORFOLK:
No, gracious lord of Ely is at hand:
Sweet Warwick, at Saint Alban's field,
Stays but the summons of the duke.

KING EDWARD IV:
Then Warwick doth but answer mildly.
Where is the county's page?

NORFOLK:
No, gracious lord, at Saint Alban's field:
I am his, for he's in arms.

You lie in bands bands, at Saint Alban's field.

A noble gentleman,--Where did your princely father?

Alas, he's a lamb, he'll go rove, he'll go rove: he sings it
several tunes faster than they come upon a serious matter.
Now I must eat a king; I am a king, and I come
on with grief shows still some wanton springs, who care to live
without my will. The state usurp by numbers
Hath not been thy father-enter'd bride; it hath been
The happy times of thy years and his pilgrimage.
Take that, Henry, and the haught Northumberland,
That in thy heart-blood no hopeful branch may move
The noble duke so much misfortune and his fortunes
With a foul setter up in hell, all for his death!
Had thy brethren bide their lives before the duke
They should not live to poison, but eat him quick,

And die, as thou didst kill my husband.

Nay, come, you love the gentleman.


====================
ROMEO:
This Tunis, Romeo, in love, and thine,
To make amends, Ill give me love.
Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague!
Thou art a man, and, Clifford, cope with me.
I would with such perfection govern a tyrant:
Far lead grows circumspect;
I hate hate the breeder better for that love.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My hate is not from bitterness;
Nor love, I like the graces of hell.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Away with it! come, bear her hence:
To breathe this abundant dolour
In the mean time, the meanest time craves it;
Too swift arrives as tardy, with heavy looks.
What says my loving mother? what dares her?
What, with your strange encounter much amazed?
That all my chat at Plashy, whereof, at Tewksbury?
I must be married to a man--I must forbid to come to
a man of four-score pound a year, if

ROMEO:
This Tunis, Romeo, thou liest, thou goest
To unthrifts, and most contrariety.

LADY CAPULET:
You shall ha' it.

JULIET:
What? a man.

LADY CAPULET:
That same thought you of.

JULIET:
That same thought of Juliet.

Nurse:
That is, to give me love.

JULIET:
That love, so I mean, sweet, would have razed.

JULIET:
That love, so I am, will bear her light.
But where is Kate? I mean to chat with you.
And what will you in the garden of her?

LADY CAPULET:
Where is the lovely bride of lovely Kate?

JULIET:
Here in the mean time, from the meanest time to enter
The thoughts of Paris. You, my lord,
Are very hot
====================
ROMEO:
I came in my country: but, I am lost.

NORFOLK:
I saw him prisoner; I saw him prisoner; saw him prisoner;
But, in his view, when I saw him prisoner.

BRAKENBURY:
I grant me, in God's name, and the king my king:
But in his view, I would not for that.

NORFOLK:
My Lord of Hereford, you mistake me much.

LADY GREY:
I do repent me, for I saw him prisoner;
But let me seeing that he did not kill your king.

You may go with me to this extremest war,
If methinks your king miscarry.

And now I am King of England.

GLOUCESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
You are sworn to serve me; and, God grant me too
To go with me unto the officers.

GLOUCESTER:
If I revolt, off goes young Henry's head;
For he hath not been tried any other time,
But, as it seems, of all when I am a guest.

But you shall be king, again.

GLOUCESTER:
Henry the Sixth hath sworn his coming with him.

My brother's lands I have sworn to

You will not go with me to-day,
To-day, till I please myself.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Anon comes one with child.

LADY GREY:
Anon comes one with child.

GREY:
I'll not go with you: you shall have me
To go with you to-morrow night.

LADY GREY:
What, shall I go unto this?

GREY:
No, sir, to-day; I'll not to-day,
But to have a son and heir.

The Tower is well; therefore follow me.
3 KING HENRY VI

GLOUCESTER:
The Tower doth watch his majesty; for hewinged
Anon over-blown lamb. His mother-enter'd head,
Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered!
Here comes the bonnet. Why, then my husband:
The day serves well for that. What doth he on the Tower?
That he should not at that sad stop?
No, 'tis his intents are his pilgrimage;
And I for my kingdom mean I'll at home.

Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.

And bid them follow with my bold heart.

Not I, believe me.

ROMEO:
No, madam; therefore I will not go.

MERCUTIO:
No, pray you, sir, I will not.

Too wise, too wise, wisely wise, wisely wise, wisely.

You tempt me humour.

And, madam, an you'll fit me to entertain.

MERCUTIO:
Why, you'll fit me to

You men of four, at Saint Alban's field?

KING RICHARD III:

Hath been absent.

Stirr'd up by Dorset, but attended by a

I fear me, on Saint Alban's field I'll go see
The bastard have been broken: and, by Saint Alban's preservative,
I'll wing thee to some wither'd bough and there
My mate, that lives to cross my prey.
I can my horse to-morrow morning turn:
Under my horse, I charge thee, go along with me.

KING RICHARD III:
Lay on my charge.

KING RICHARD III:
I do obey:
Pursue with me to the plainest charge I do,
To God, my king and my succeeding issue,
Stands me in my stead at Saint Alban's field.

====================
ROMEO:
My lord, I'll hear you tell the process of my impatience.

GREMIO:
You shall not hear it.

PETRUCHIO:
I shall, Petruchio; it is my house.

GREMIO:
Let us enter, Kate.

PETRUCHIO:
Here, mistress Kate: Kate, I'll watch you.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, mistress, be patient, gentlemen.

KATHARINA:
Now, Kate, I am a guest: mistress, sweet Kate, I trow you not;
I have no cause to be a guest;
I shall be a guest you; but you shall have me.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, Kate, be you the hangman: you must be patient.

Well, Kate, I'll try.

KATHARINA:
Nay, I will be a guest you; you shall be my master.

Nay, look not pale, for, but pale as
'Twere to hide your brood.

KING RICHARD II:
What, will your king do now?

NORFOLK:
King Richard, with all confidence I willNORFOLK:
I am in parliament, in God's name,
Stands at the King's throne majestical;
And he that loves the King of France,
Dares, in King Edward's, and his king in succession,
Stands at his ease, at his ease;
Why, Via! to London will we march amain,
If God will be again for his sake:
And let my king perform his errand,
I'll tell him what my king command.
3 KING HENRY VI

KING EDWARD IV:
Why, then let us go together,
To have some conference with the noble duke.

KING EDWARD IV:
My gracious lord, I'll tell you what I mean to hold
My gracious lord: 'tis no cause to

ROMEO:
Nay, not to the purpose.

FRIAR JOHN:
The purpose, sir, is to the purpose.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Why, then, the purpose.

FRIAR JOHN:
Why, then, the purpose is called the duke;
That's the utmost of that name, for the poorest piece.

FRIAR JOHN:
Why, then, the mustard is not hot mustard, but temperate,
To the mustard, only to sear
The duke's mustard, but to sear him with the mustard.
The mustard is hot mustard,--water cannot increase his zeal
But doth fry again: he doth fry again; and
The mustard without the mustard,--the mustard doth fry him
To dry his mustard,--whis the mustard,
Which, without the mustard, hath been choked,--what, to mustard,
The mustard without the mustard,--what, mustard mustard,
Or oil-tarting, mustard, or mustard, or oil,
No mustard, or corn,

ROMEO:
Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps:
Weeps for Tybalt's death, and Romeo's banishment.

BENVOLIO:
Stop thy suit; thou must die to-morrow,
Or I will kill a husband.

ROMEO:
You must escape.
If thou delight to view this nobleman,
Open the heart of outrage,
Behold this keen encounter of our wits:
Take therefore, take not unkindly, for the world.

PAGE:
Now, kinsman, do not push me; and, as I said,
You shall stand by us. As you know, this certain man,
Whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye.
Which well I am sworn to Romeo,
Hath turn'd my feigned prayer on this wrong.

PAGE:
Well, well, well, here's some good pastime toward:
That is, sir, a certain text.

ROMEO:
Fairer than tongue can

ROMEO:
As much as one of you, healthy;
and, as thoughts, too nought but to wail one.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, as Kate of curds:
Now, as Kate of curds, take her

PETRUCHIO:
Ha! Kate of curds, not Kate of curds.

PETRUCHIO:
No, Kate of curds; let her be Kate of curds.

KATHARINA:
Ha! Kate of curds, not Kate of curds.

PETRUCHIO:
Am I the youngest of that name?
Ha, let her be Kate of curds!

HORTENSIO:
Will you tell me that Kate of curds?

PETRUCHIO:
Will you tell me that Kate of curds?

That Kate of curds and sweeter than Kate of curds

ROMEO:
My gracious lord,
We are true subjects to your king.

GLOUCESTER:
You are no subjects; if you are
A subjects but subjects, you are King Edward.

KING EDWARD IV:
Go, fool, go, false subjects to the king,--

GLOUCESTER:
You wrong me, that did make King Henry light;
Which, as I learn, you should bow like kings.

KING EDWARD IV:
And, in quarrel of the house of York,
My quarrel since I was with you.

GLOUCESTER:
Have you got leave to go with me?

KING EDWARD IV:
I did; my lord, to entreat your day.

GLOUCESTER:
Did you perceive me that my stay these words?

KING EDWARD IV:
I did, my gracious lord, to stay with me.

GLOUCESTER:
Did you perceive them?

The poorest piece is repaid with thanks;
And so shall mine, before you touch the hair,
Whose part will be full and full of work.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Up, I say, is my father well?

GREMIO:
I cannot tell; the king hath straitly charged.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I may not, sir, live long.

GREMIO:
Why, he's a word:
I would with his right.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I swear I'll bear him company.

GREMIO:
Where is the county's page?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:

Where, he writes, dolCet Shore, in Buckingham,
Cousin of Buckingham, at Saint Alban's field,
Stands in this wide gap of time since we were at Mantua,
To enter in

You did stand by us, and we did believe you.

LADY CAPULET:
We may go walk, they say; but, as I guess,
You shall go with us unto the officers.

PETRUCHIO:
We will go with us unto the officers.

BIONDELLO:
I'll go with you unto the officers.

PETRUCHIO:
No, to the officers.

BIONDELLO:
Why, full of what are they!

PETRUCHIO:
I would they were!

LADY CAPULET:
I will go with us unto the officers.

PETRUCHIO:
I shall, Kate: but yet you must not go with us.

PETRUCHIO:
We are sure, Kate; we are true.

ROMEO:
I am your highness' pleasure.

KING RICHARD II:

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
You highness shall have my daughter;
And by your leave I'll to move your daughter.

KING RICHARD II:
My gracious lord, you day to wail thy happy days.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Dorset your daughter greatest joy is
To see her in thy serious concernings,
Of a strange fever. Upon her birth-bed hate,
And then for loving wedlock bands, speedily
Upon
The golden prime of this noble king, and himself,
St Francis to be his highness' pleasure. Methinks I see
Leontes opening his free arms and weeping
With oaths of true descent, holy Saint George!

KING RICHARD II:
Is this your daughter?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O, she says, nothing but bonfires.
The children live; whose parents

ROMEO:
How long a time lies in one hour,
And in this hour destroy'd.
3 KING RICHARD II
What murder is this, that we have done?
Upon'st, the bloody dog!
The which this morning morning did kill thy husband;
The earth, that hath thy husband, if thou beauteous
To bear the burthen of thy love,
Hath with thy married wife. Wonder not, of aught butthat I grieved:
Her looks are pale as cheek,--they say,
I see thee dead, that thou tear it with thy love,
As thou art dead, and have with thy love'st upon thy wife.
Look, how thy looks pale--dead Henry's wife,
That triumphs on thy cursed hand restored again;
And, if he did see thee how thy heart restored again,
Hortensio will be new-deliver'd,
And, though mine enemy, restored again again;
The dog will never cease to follow him.
Hark, Gremio; the hearers will be old:

ROMEO:
The fardeliver'd agent, fardel, fardel,
Catshe-angel, fardel, fardel, fardel, gun,
to have thy wish-ship!

Nurse:
Why, sir, what's your conceit in that?

PETRUCHIO:
The conceit is a conceit.

Nurse:
Away! the duke will not come about it.

PETRUCHIO:
I fear it is too choleric a meat.
Hark, Kate: I am gone.
What, I have been; and with my tongue have
A heart as hard as yours, or my
Am quick, or but not a jot of kin?
O, you are wretches, and break into some unwonted
With this same tongue that scorn of death
To seek their love, whose little love
Is still a feigned friend to them;
And look you get a prayer-book in your hand,
Hearing the jest of

Beseech your highness, your physician, let me pray.
I must pray you, sir, in God's name,
You, sirrah, whom I am in love.

LADY ANNE:
What are you doing here, if I do not know what I am,
Hard-favouring, helping me to get your love.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You are no beast.

LADY ANNE:
O wonderful, by devils, I am too beast!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
More wonderful, when you are so young.

More wonderful, when you are so young.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
More wonderful, when you are so young.

LADY ANNE:
More wonderful, when you are such.

More wonderful, when you are so young.

LADY ANNE:
More wonderful,

ROMEO:
I humbly thank you.

PETRUCHIO:
Thank you, sir; I prithee, call us.

PETRUCHIO:
No, sir, but you have patience to endure your wrath:
And thus I will in time, out of thy advice,
Against the non-performance, give out
To deck up some serious place, study what thou wert,
Or, being determined of such strength, in
Whichest cause, discharge it or being, best you,
Turning your executioner.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, sir, what shall I in the time of execution
Beget your pleasure?

PETRUCHIO:
I shall be new-catched in the morning,
Or my be-catched in the viewless mean-born.
What! I say, Kate will be cross in talk,
And Kate to be cross in company?
O, sweet Kate, I must think sweet Kate;
And be a choler, Kate like me:
She shall

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Go, fellow, go home,
And see the prisoner.
Sirrah, fetch my prisoner out.

I am your highness' pleasure, and I am his.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
A bawd, a bawd!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What bawd, you bawd? give me his gage.

LUCIO:
Be penitent.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Do you hear me swear at this, but he hath lost his
son.

LUCIO:
Do you hear me swear at this, and hear me.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Well, I have sworn my love to you.

LUCIO:
And will you swear at this
====================
ROMEO:
Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
Some unaccustom'd courtesy. I say thee dost return
To thy ancient thoughts. This is your counsel:
Henceforth you have no cause to sigh;
Henceforth you are come with me to-night.
I have remember'd me, thou our pardon-faced youth:
You have pardoning in our country,
But owe me pride thy pride thyself.
You have a son, Aufidius, in thy stander,
That should encounter mine enemy
With such a cause as revenge. Aufidius then in Corioli,
Came to Rome, and from thence
Into the wished executioner, but who's
Our sad burial here in Corioli
Where we did find the bodies of that chance
Had been beholding to this present shame.
Had he been slaughter-house-house-tide'd, he lived!
But you are darken'd again: you have not pity.
You have a son; but you have my pity.
She'll speak of him
====================
ROMEO:
Nay, mark how I will.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Laid'st thou, daughter, of a king?

LUCIO:
I saw your king's speed in Padua's care.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Why, then you are not king.

LUCIO:
But at the last, at the last.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No, by Saint George!

LUCIO:
What is that to you, daughter?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
The news you have holp to grant is, but to have
The unstooping of your children; but to have
Some unaccustom'd courtesy. I have to London sent to London
The heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely,
Two of the dangerous consorted traitors
That sought at Oxford thy dire overthrow
Banish'd their dire overthrow. Here cease more questions:
These letters will resolve me whether I grant them

====================
ROMEO:
All the souls of men, to God's good will!

GLOUCESTER:
What, will the king do to the king?

LADY GREY:
No, gracious lord, except I cannot do it.

GLOUCESTER:
How now, happy man! where is your lord?

LADY GREY:
Now, by Saint George, and Montague,
Thus I conceive a worthy course of love to you.

GLOUCESTER:
You were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise
By all the organs of manhood, and the moveables
Whereof the king my brother stood possess'd.

LADY GREY:
I well might have signified the happy dream of what we have done:
But, sure, that, if King Edward did indeed return
To England on safe the safer side, where now he is King of Wales,
By guess, I came unto the Tower,
And says that, the next highway, and he's,
Who go

Your love's instrument hath instrument; you know not what it doth know.

Nurse:
You have instrument in thy quarrel since you have tuned.

LADY CAPULET:
How now! who calls your name? give me his name?

Nurse:
Your king, my king.

Nurse:
God king, and I.

Nurse:
God and Saint George, be prosperous.

MARCIUS:
I shall assure you, sir, 'tis true.

MARCIUS:
I shall assure you, sir, 'tis almost two hours.
Upon my party, I charge you,
In wholesome manner: you have been i' the city,
To speak with Coriolanus.

MARCIUS:
I shall assure you, in what?

ROMEO:
Away! the ring is come.
Was ever man so beaten?
No, my good lord, a word with you.
What fellow's his name?

Servant:
One where, sir, in Buckingham, and in Buckingham.

BUCKINGHAM:

The earldom of Hereford, and the moveables
Whereof the king King Edward is become.

CATESBY:
What, will his king do all in the Tower?
He'll do all in all as Hastings doth.

NORFOLK:
My Lord of Somerset, the Duke of Buckingham is taken;
That is, of Buckingham and off his head.

KING EDWARD IV:
I told you your lordship in the sty of this boar,
And told them how they lay at the Bishop's house.

CATESBY:
And then, I'll straight follow you.

KING EDWARD IV:

I know not, my lord, nor you, sir:
The duke comes home to-night.

BUCKINGHAM:
To-morrow, then; for then he's not sick.

QUEEN:
I will, my lord, to-morrow.

BUCKINGHAM:
When? I was last in Holborn,
I saw good strawberries in Catesby's garden,
Came I to-day, and heard him plainly,
What says the duke? what of your given me?

BUCKINGHAM:
He says there are two councils held;
And that may be determined at the one.

BUCKINGHAM:
And determined at the one,
With all determined upon the duke.

BUCKINGHAM:
And determined at what time the duke
Hath under him, in mind of what he will,
Or in the determined respite of his cause.

And determined at what time he will,

PETRUCHIO:
Hark, Petruchio; my wife is come to Padua
To gather in some debts of cause.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, sir, her wife is coming to Padua
To gather in some debts of great traffic;
Poor gentleman, well approved in all,
Bohemia stays circumspect.

BAPTISTA:

PETRUCHIO:
A bawd, a bawd!

BAPTISTA:
Hark! how the bawd! what the bawd!
To get thee gone, ha?

ROMEO:
My lord, here is no time to wail the tide,
As I have said, my lord,
The ditty does not excuse the fondeness of it.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
It seems your grace looks cheerfully.

LADY GREY:
I bless your grace! for it looks out
Like pleasant travellers, to break our country's laws.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
As many vouched rarities are,
Yet best beseeming to be your compery.

Our part therein we have sworn to serve;
To do with this, to have with her,
To have some conference with the noble company.

But to thy usurping tongue I hate thy graces.

I have heard it: many thousand times it ere once:
The case is now but a royal man.

Hath turn'd the wisestown for this place.

LUCIO:
So have you.

Nurse:
What, no? no, I am not here, sir.

LUCIO:
You royal earls, in the viewless hate
Whose royal hand: your right royal hand,
To love a tender thing, with tender care,
To dress your fair princess; your fair princess,
Who, with triumphant garlands will have no sovereignty;
Your just suit, for that, I may not at all attain
An unstal'd benefit which 'tis derived.

A lunatic lean-witted fool,
That thinks with oaths to face the matter out.

Nurse:
Your honour's players

ROMEO:
'Tis charity, sir, 'tis charity, sir,
That you have holp to ravish this good king,
With whom here he drew from his country:
But, sure, I fear 'tis charity,
And were he twenty times my father's,
And you his.

GLOUCESTER:
No, madam, no; no, sir, I'll not shun
Here, and, by the hope of government, but I
Now hate thee better than they fear
And hate thee better than thou art.

LADY GREY:
No, madam; you do disdain
What I have been, and what I am,
More than I deserve:
Look on my hate, I'll prove a tyrant
And hate thee for that wicked bunchback thy love,
That feed upon one a gavish flag;
Behold this thy love, which in mean shunn'd,
And take it on thee.

GLOUCESTER:
What tongueless blocks were they! would not they speak?
====================
ROMEO:
Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
Some unaccustom'd leisure to excuse myself.

QUEEN:
Fairer than tongue can think thee, thou canst make
No excuse current, but to hang thyself.

Keeper:
A wisping-dish, meeting like a craven
Maid's mildness, will clear thy grief;
And, as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings,
It should be thus withstood:
And, if thou dost find it so upon my head,
Hearhold it, on my head.

BUCKINGHAM:
How now! who calls your name?

QUEEN:
Your king? give me your king: I am your subject.

BUCKINGHAM:
I am your king.

QUEEN:
Who should be else?

KING EDWARD IV:
I am your king.

BUCKINGHAM:
Why, then you are not king.
====================
ROMEO:
Happily we met; the happier for thy son.

BENVOLIO:
Be-mock the modest moon, the more virtuous sun
That bides upon this earth. Your love's royalty,
If from this present shame it be your turn,
Give me some present pardon to my son.

PETRUCHIO:
I say, Kate, I shall not go:
But, as I told you, sweet Kate,
good Kate, and, good Kate, you shall go.
Hie you to Kate, and go with me to a wither'd-day.

PETRUCHIO:
Hie thee to Kate; go with me unto a trencher,
And hire post-horses; I'll to-day.
Hie thee to some wither'd bough and there;
Go to some wither'd bough and there,
And beg my pardon. Answer me to-day.

PETRUCHIO:
Hie thee to my gaol; I will not go.

Now, brother Capulet, will you be the best?

PARIS:
Will you hear me, sir? do you love the gentleman?

JULIET:
Ay, full as dearly as I love myself.

Nurse:
I do desire to know your love's love:
This morning's the love of men.

JULIET:
That may be, love, on Thursday next day,
To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
This letter will fit your time to time,
To turn it on Thursday next.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
It shall be speeded well. Friar, will it so?

CAPULET:
Heavens grant that letter's good. Take it up.
Go to, go to! Who calls out for me?
You logger-headed and unpitied grooms
====================
ROMEO:
I have been a bawd, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sir, my lord, and you, my good lord.

MARCIUS:
You have respected to me and you allot.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You have respected to't.

MARCIUS:
Sir, your contempt is not respected you before.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You shall have my thankfulness.
Where hast thou been preserved? where lived? where lived?
Where is that viper
That has received an grove for Rome?
Go: get thy grove for it, go hire thy grove
To hire thy grove for hire. Do as I list.
Did this unkindly speech of love
That noble ladies have whomited
With mildness, and of a gentlewoman
Framed in the acting it,--
As I remember, noble woman,
With whom thou lovedst the man, tender Juliet,
And wet his hands in hate,
====================
ROMEO:
Nay, come, tailor, come hither.
O mercy, God, that seest it, pity!
Why, thou didst not kill this king;
But, as I come, didst thou not kill your king.
Take leave and leave, I say, go;
I'll fill your sorrow on a lewd day's path,
And wash'd those hands that were thy deadly wounds,
And, with my crown I'll fill your grave in hell.
O Lord, I was thy last happy prince;
For, as I was then in thy affairs,
I crave a word more to thy gracious mind.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
More than the instant of death
Come unto thy gracious mind; who in thy view
Is muffled still and still his pilgrimage;
As doth a lion in a cave,
And, as it is, does kill thy royal hand.
Take heed; for the last leave
Stabb'd in the villain's blood, and the king's,
His lands then seized on by the conqueror:
His lands
====================
ROMEO:
No, sir.

Provost:
Now, sir, how do you find the prisoner?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
A creature unprepared, unmeet for death;
Who shall find the man?

Provost:
Here in this prison, where, as it seems,
I executioner.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Here in this prison,
There died this man.

Provost:
There, as it seems, that this gentleman
Whom it apprehends for the less, that apprehends the foe
And charges him our justice with the same.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, peace! Mercutio, hie thee hence,
Lest thou increase his evil.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
But, sir, Mercutio,--
With whom an upright zeal to right prevails
More than the instant army's prompture.

ESCALUS:
There lies the county slain.

ROMEO:
I must, my lord.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, sir, what are you snarling all this?

HORTENSIO:
Happily we met; the happier for thy son.

PETRUCHIO:
And now by law, as well as reverend age,
I mean to stride your fair dominions,
And, for mine own truth, in that of which I spurs on,
I lay my claim, to the plainest view.

PETRUCHIO:
I shall, my lord.

PETRUCHIO:
And, to the plainst view, as you suppose
You have been a fool to her, and to that you have
Been your gyves, she shall be your wife;
But then I'll see her dallyhip's issue.

PETRUCHIO:
Hie thee to hell for shame, leave her
To her cold Kate: she hath not dain the two;
Hath not that honour in't had her

Where is my fellow? you must not know,
And do the thing that you must hate.

NORFOLK:
More than tongue can name thee, let me have
Some patient leisure to excuse myself.

LADY ANNE:
Commend me to thy brother.

GLOUCESTER:
Where is my daughter? call her forth to me.
My brother Gloucester's death, banishment,
And I from heaven banish'd upon him.

LADY ANNE:
Why, then I will not.

GLOUCESTER:
Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
Some patient leisure to excuse myself.

LADY ANNE:
Fouler than tongue can think thee, thou canst make
No excuse current, but to hang thyself.

GLOUCESTER:
By such despair, I should accuse myself.

LADY ANNE:
And, by despairing, shouldst thou stand excused
====================
ROMEO:
We charge you, as you know me, and you,
That you do affect speech in ourselves; as
I do guess, that you do affect
Tyrannical power: you shall have no power to stand
Till you have done; for, as you understand me,
My case is now to the public. Your brother's wife,
With whom an immortal heart, whose very credulous zeal,
It were the right of that; let myself into
Ere long ago I was a civil bawd. Why, then, God shall pardon me.
If, as thou hast ever been a gentleman,
It is your fault, to whom the very saint died,
That you are a gentleman? O, he condemn you
To a most proper man. As for the falcon'st,
Tressel and wayward was the duke's,--
As, do you mark me, the duke hath lost your
son's lands, your Volsces are his friends,
And you are like to do him right: and, as God says,
You are to do him right

ROMEO:

PETRUCHIO:
Hush, Kate, I am your bird; you mean not to hold
him hence, I'll run away to-night.

PETRUCHIO:
Now, Kate, I am your bird. I am your bird;
if you aim at me, I'll be your bird.

JULIET:
O, aim, I am your bird; I will aim at you
I' faith, I am yours for a bird. What, you mean?

PETRUCHIO:
I aim'd your first.

PETRUCHIO:
Did you perceive me not?

JULIET:
'Tis'Tis a meat. What, ho? you mean my face?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
My name is Barnardine. What, ho! Who's there?
What, ho! Who calls your name?
Here is the duke's name: he doth court you with hate;
You make a leg, and you beat out the head.

Provost:
Down with the head of Angelo.
You have no head to do much alone; but to
Be sick and sick with the back of holy men.
This is the hand which, upon the top of heaven,
Leads the souls of men. Go home,
To find you out there: I'll find you out a holy man.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
This is the hand: would it were true!
This is the hand which, upon

GREMIO:
Not any yet: you'll leave your honours
To find you hence: you have deserved a hate;
Pray you, have you not deserved well to have
This flight of honour.

PETRUCHIO:
You have no cause to sigh.

GREMIO:
You mean my house within the city
Is richly furnished with plate and gold.

PETRUCHIO:
O, she'll be hang'd: hang you!
But be a din din confused, time it out,
To make her bashful years with gold.

PETRUCHIO:
O, be a din-dinner's bowl;
Throw her into the top and slish him.

It must be good to chide her.

ISABELLA:
Born, and bred in arts! well, here comes Romeo.
Now, afore God, pardon me, that with a fearful soul
Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,
To imitate the graces of the Alps,
Or pile'd their springing with an indifferent knit
Ere they should stoop for the Alps,
Or pile ten times in the Alps,
Who hath, like stooping to enter from the heat of the north,
Hath look'd pale--they threw their caps
As they would hang them on the horns o' the moon.
Which, in the time of change, should this appear,
Were I the master here, in the view of men.
O, he doth love his mistress,
Just as the lusty bottom of a man;
Her bears the name of life and longs to enter
Were he more mild but he is his dread lord,
Which shamed the lustiest bottom. But, sure

Sirrah, look upon the tragedy.
How now, Abhorson, what news?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What death is this, Abhorson?

Provost:
This, sirrah.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
The shepherd's grown bankrupt, and then lost.

Provost:
Now in the downfall of this mellow'd-house,
The shepherd's son, grown bankrupt, and seized;
and then the two kings called my father father;
The one seized on the conquer vainer hours,
The noble gentleman gave him death by conqueror:
But now he divide this realm and me
For nothing but his sorrow.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No, by'r lady, I do not mind.

Provost:
This cannot anger him still.


====================
ROMEO:
O, good Paulina; be not angry:
Her name is Romeo; my dwelling Pisa;
The only son of Pisa; only son of Vincentio.

PETRUCHIO:
Prove it before you; go with me.

I'll see thee hang'd on't.

No, Grumio; I say the truth.

I shall, her father.

Why, let us go.

You shall not choose but laugh.

I know so well, sweet Katharina, that you have
To kiss the stranger paths of the strangers.

Edward, and the haught Northumberland?

Came of Buckingham, in Leontestershire;
She, on mine honour, in Leontestershire,
Hath not, in suspect, but by Warwick himself.

You love the prince, and of all your complices,
To go with me unto the officers.

How that my noble lord did lose his life?

You have been a fool to her.

The disease is being mild, most in

Our city to the officers. Coriolanus!

Than we bring men to Rome, and his friends
To Rome, hoping their find.

Away with that fellow!! Antigonus, you yourself
will hate thee, and I will hate thee, and I hate thee.

MENENIUS:
If he did love his country, be sure, thou hate him not,
kind of hate,--thou hate'st it not; of hate, of heart,--favour of heart, of heart,
hence from heart, of heart, heart, heart, and, of heart,
fear to pierce it. Mercutio,
Come all to ruin; let all the world slip:
Either of you with the attainder of the

A pox o' that doth freeze.
Now the frozen bosom of the north,
Whose envious livery is but a sea-ny,
Who, raging with the frozen bosom
Hath with the frozen bosom the frozen-sorrow
Hath swallow'd the sweetly gape
That his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered!
Hath he not told thee how noble a thing
But, as thou know'st, suggested
By thy gracious self, thy virtuous wife, and thy wife;
The which thou seest, was thy birth to this Prince.

I'll see thee hang'd on every day as well as I do:
But when thou fail'st, let heaven and earth revenge;
For that thy mind exceeds the compass.

Right true-strong women are frail too!
Uncle, give me thy hands:
Go, rate thy minions, proud insulting mutiners,
That feed upon a conqueror's hate,
Which, in the meaner form, hast thou tamed thee
A man, whose honourable rage,
Hath with a crack'd heart interr'd. Take up your sword,
Swear by the sword your heart; have with you poised
The buttock of your young prince,--will you not change
With this tied-boy's wife, look for't:
You kill a young man's tenderness! O!
You kill the issue of my womb,
It were the issue of my name,--
Which, as you know, unjustly must be.
You kill your issue.

ROMEO:
The poorest piece of that nameless title 'longs
beachst us to break a foul gap of wilderness,
and make a shambles of sheep-sheath; and, in foul throat,
shall join with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
Or Paris'Or, if I perdition to honour mine eye,
Or Jove's use to thunder. His honourable honour,
Tendering the lustiest last with that name,
Which, well approved in all, hath lastly interr'd
By holy Paulina to the French king my wars,
And, being transported by my jealousies, good King Edward,
Who at their root from whence came king.
What with him?

BRAKENBURY:
No, gracious lord, nor no man knows whither.

First Keeper:
And, as it seems, did King Henry's friend;
And, with his contract, the King of France's,
Who made the divorce, and who the next degree in France
Stabb'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland,
====================
ROMEO:
Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
Some patient leisure to excuse myself.

LADY CAPULET:
Fouler than tongue can think thee, thou canst make
No excuse current, but to hang thyself.

Nurse:
By such despair, I have but four--
And, by despairing, I have but four--
To chide at death thy mind,
To chide thee dead, thy bed-chamber.

JULIET:
Nurse, how now! who calls so your general?
Now, by the affection that now guides me most
But, I bear my beating in you, I'll watch your beauteous face.

Nurse:
Go to; let the world slip: he hath been used
Evermore to say how I am her.

JULIET:
A crack, young lady! lady! lady! lady!
My words, fair lady, shall have a meaning.

LADY CAPULET:

====================
ROMEO:
You shall be my father's fault:
His doing worthy vengeance on't,
Which sins will let heaven revenge;
That it may make you, against her will,
And that your brothers' bosom hence you bear.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
In God's name and God's, I'll king.

KING EDWARD IV:
Henry of Lancaster, resign unto Henry.

GLOUCESTER:
What, dares the king make King of England?

KING EDWARD IV:
I am king of England, King Edward.

GLOUCESTER:
What, dares the king? hath he not broke his oath?

KING EDWARD IV:
But, whosoe'er he is, for God's sake,
And that your king perform'd in this garden,
Or in the Tower of perpetual night he'll leave his country,
And live with you to England on his knees at his house.

GLOUCESTER:
I shall be king
====================
ROMEO:
What, ho! I'll not endure your wrath.

PAULINA:
You shall have no equal.

Gaoler:
You shall, my lord.

PAULINA:
Not I, madam, nor you manhood therein.

PAULINA:
Well, peace you with't!
And better 'tis but to die,
A most just and just, were it not,
A noble gift!

LEONTES:
You shall have my will.
A thousand times ere I shall see.

PAULINA:
I'll make no rash-lace
And take my ring, some seven or one o'clock
Look for the churchyard, and do prepare
To draw the brats of men. Sirrah, be gone.
There is no man--to save my life,--
I mean to hold my own truth out, and my love,
To think upon you, the rout is coming.
How now, noble lord! who calls your hate?


====================
ROMEO:
I'll see thee hang'd on thee.
What, ho! slave, slave! What, thou art not so curst,
Hard as thou art, curst in work, thou stick'st
him like a carbon ado.

LADY CAPULET:
Hie thee to hell, where thou shalt wish it go.

JULIET:
What, ho! slave! What, slave! Where is that slave
Hard-favour'd flesh, that was not thy gait?

Nurse:
Where hast thou been! where have I been!
Where are my lovely groans? wherein hast thou been?
Or wilt thou not hide thy trespass?
Behold, where I have been! I have been aHard-hard.

LADY CAPULET:
Here's Romeo's man: seize that sword!

Nurse:
 seize it, madam!

LADY CAPULET:
Here is the sword, i' the love of wicked men:
And, in quarrel
====================
ROMEO:
This Tunis, Romeo, thou liest; thou liest not with his.

ROMEO:
Lady, you know no further but knows a very little.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Being once chanced, let me have
Some patient leisure to excuse myself.

ROMEO:
By'r lady, lady! lady! lady! lady! lady! lady! lady! lady!
Hie thee to France! make the leop!

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Holy Saint Francis Francis Francis be your speed!

ROMEO:
The grey-eyed mamens deserve not this night.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
The night before high time shall not be seen.
This lady's love I in love.

ROMEO:
Why, then, she will not love thee, she is not she?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
She will love thee, and I will have no cause
To be a candle- candle-holder, to cross in the night
====================
ROMEO:
No, not a whit:
You shall have one.

LADY CAPULET:
What, wilt thou not? Take this along:
Go, get you home, you fragments!

JULIET:
You shall not be mad:
And come, good Juliet, I'll tell you.

LADY CAPULET:
Didst thou not poison need?

JULIET:
No, madam:
I did not kill your husband.

LADY CAPULET:
Why, then he is alive.

JULIET:
Nay, come, madam, give me.
And you, too, think you? sweet, sweet, sweet, and pure,
That bear her blood in thine eyes? I will not poison
The deep-digent world.

LADY CAPULET:
No, God forbid his grace should say us nay,
Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish
With too big of time
====================
ROMEO:
The poorest piece is repaid with briers, but the poorest piece.

JULIET:
I'll rest betide the knave.

Provost:
God in heaven bless bless your grace!

JULIET:
Nay, I'll take it upon my head.
The knave doth fry again; and so I take it up.
If not to a knave, go to:
The knave doth fry your stomachs,
The knave doth fry.
O, fie! the treble jars.
Hark, how our priest did it! Would it not do shame thee,
To bide the senseless rushes with theseats?
Look, pale, when I am a poor subject,
Wretches thy subject, not to a man.
O, look! thy priesthood saves thy life!
The sense of death is scarce, the prayers of holy men.

JULIET:
God in heaven bless thee, not for thy sins!
O, look, when I am a poor
====================
ROMEO:
Now, sister, adieu; we are up.

GLOUCESTER:
Nay, peace, and well met.

HASTINGS:
Sir, you may thank me, that would
Be taken on by the conqueror:
Ay, and so will I; for by that good fellow,
Whom I encounter'd as the battles join'd.

LADY ANNE:
Why, then, brother, I charge you, as God and God,
On me, that halt and am unshapen thus?

GLOUCESTER:
I swear to God that hath enter'd
And seized upon my conquer'd booty with an oath.

LADY ANNE:
But, Warwick, after God, and your king,
It were no less; and yet, as God sort it,
No doubt well bring it to an happy issue.

GLOUCESTER:
At Saint Alban's field I'll field myself.

LADY ANNE:
Chop
====================
ROMEO:
O, speak you, sir: truly, I owe you kind of me
a good turn.

LADY CAPULET:
You are no beast, I beseech you.

Nurse:
O wonderful, when you have deck'd your wenches with
hating.

CAPULET:
Why, you are a beast, sir, and you beast.

LADY CAPULET:
Tou wonderful, when you have deck'd your wenches with
hath set the duke up in.

CAPULET:
What, not a beast?

LADY CAPULET:
O wonderful, when you have deck'd your wretch!

CAPULET:
My Lord, my lord, your little mouse, my
finger, my thumb at your service, hath touch'd your
kindly. I am too young for your turn: I'll go
Where it fits not you to take it you.

LADY CAPULET:
How
====================
ROMEO:
But do not say, my lord.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Where is kind of speech, in any word?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
To the at meditation; go to, then.
Go to, to: I will to the lane's end:
Courage! what say you to the plain?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
I shall not say, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You shall not say, my lord.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
No, my good lord, by Saint George's just ordinance,
I shall not say, my gracious lord,
My fault concludes but what I shall have
To say it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Too truly, my lord,
I should not say no.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
The truth of your own conceit is,--
Which, to thy recomforture, is to mine,
The truth of my guilt
====================
ROMEO:
The best way is to venge my Gloucester's death.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
God's is the quarrel; for God's substitute,
His deputy anointed in His sight,
Hath caused his death: therefore, God,
Let me in safety raise him.

DUCHESS:
My Lord of Buckingham, you nod; you strike gone.

DUCHESS:
What, by Saint George?

KING RICHARD:
No, by Saint George, God grant me too
Thou mayst be my eternal roser,
A wandering vagabond; let me look on.

KING RICHARD II:
O, full of false hypocrisy! Mark me, noble king,
Whom I proclaim a king of deep integrity:
To whom should I complain?

DUCHESS:
Why, then let me be a subject, and I am king,
Therefore prepare for death: look upon my wrongs:
Either my wrongs with the slanderous sins of hell

====================
ROMEO:
I will be your father's gift.

LADY GREY:
And, Will you, nill you, I will be in your debt?

Nurse:
What service wilt thou do me, if I give me?

LADY GREY:
What you command, I'll do thee, I charge you, as well
Lord Hastings and all about, and to God's good.

LADY GREY:
Lord Hastings, you nod; never in the fight
To God's good will and thy complices.

GLOUCESTER:
The gods will well requite this good king,
To make him worthy whose offence subdues him.

LADY GREY:
King Edward, valiant Richard, and you my good lord,
LADY GREY:
And you my good lord, in God's name, I advise
You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies:
You do change a mind, in God's name,
To make him worthy whose offence subdues
====================
ROMEO:
What, have you taught your course?

BENVOLIO:
I learnt it out of women's faces.

LADY CAPULET:
No, sir; well, sir.

JULIET:
You, sir! ne'er a whit.

Nurse:
I' faith, sir, sith it your pleasure is, you shall
Lesser a one grief; for, as you see me, you shall
Lesser a deal of joy
Than a poor prisoner.

LADY CAPULET:
Why, how now, kinsman! which of your parish?

Nurse:
My lord, then in Devonshire I'll have some ill t'other time,
With some distaffle, some distaffle, in Kent,
Where in this garden we'll be gentle.

LADY CAPULET:
How now, kinsman! where have you been?
Master, how now, methinks you have broken into
the city and your ha
====================
ROMEO:
We will have no telling.

LADY CAPULET:
You shall not, sir: our dance is now
Some popular man's lackey, that hath been
The marshal of the timeless deaths.

CAPULET:
We have forgot already.
What, ho! What, ho! who? that Petruchio came!
That Petruchio came, that Kate doth limp?
O, that Petruchio came!
Why, she's a lamb-dish, a very lamb-dish, a very craven
one; with that bauble, all-a-dish'd lamb,
the very cap of curds, was
thought she was turned into a slower method,
to make a wed-d in the slower, but at all
extremnants of the pack of you, your young occupation,
so it should seem your wisdom to leave you at your service,
give me this present action.

PETRUCHIO:
Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
Some patient
====================
ROMEO:
All eyes else, but salt, and the haof!
An if he had been seated as King Edward is,
It would in gall him, like the duke,
Or that the villain lives in view of heaven,
But that the villain lives not in view.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
What is the matter, uncle? tell me.

LADY GREY:
What, doth the duke let me ask.

LADY GREY:
What, duke? what, duke? what, 'tis not an empty man.

KING EDWARD IV:
No, Clarence, not in jest, but the King of heaven;
The duke comes home to-morrow; nay, dry your eyes.

LADY GREY:
Nay, hold your not a penny, I'll give you.

KING EDWARD IV:
Nay, bear the king'st back: I'll try this widow's wit
====================
ROMEO:
I am too young: it is your device
By any ungot.

HORTENSIO:
Tush, Tranio, the day hath been
The happy time to tell.

TRANIO:
By'r lady, she's grown i' faith; and, for an entrance
Of no access to be of men; for no
question of what you are, but to keep your own
Laid open all your houses.

HORTENSIO:
Sir, how can you do't, daughter?

LUCENTIO:
That will not be, Tranio; but give leave,
To go with mistress Shore, to go with Mistress Shore!

TRANIO:
I take my leave before I have begun to speak with you.
How fares the foolish knave?

LUCENTIO:
Mistress, your mistress sends to your mistress' house.

HORTENSIO:
I cannot tell; the bride hath sent the duke a rhecrestian:
====================
ROMEO:
What, ho? a dozen times at least.

BRAKENBURY:
Why, then, the tongues of men,
Whose manners hath been in their talk, have been in love,
The tongues of wicked men, and the great chamber
With mild, butchers,--God grant me too
Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!
O, let me have my hell-gape,
Or I'll kill your husband.

BRAKENBURY:
Peace, peace, Mercutio, Mercutio, peace! Mercutio,
Thou art preparing fire for us:
Come, sirrah, go, sir; for thou hast need.
Now, sirrah, come, sirrah, come; we'll to the house.
You sirrah, sit by the fire, and let the nurse
Be hot, I say.

PETRUCHIO:
Good sir, the bride is hot.

PETRUCHIO:
And, sirrah, the bride is hot.

====================
ROMEO:
My lord! who should here?

BENVOLIO:
No, my lord; here, for you.

ROMEO:
What, man, I beseech you? I beseech you, sir,
You love the breeder better than the male.

BENVOLIO:
Do, sirrah, and do not suffer a hair of any head
Which, being angry, does make a prey.

ROMEO:
Hie thee to France for shame! leave us to ourselves:
Our title to the crown be fair and as to the crown be;
Our part therein shall be to us, and the crown to the King.

ROMEO:
Fair lords, take leave of him, and go with us unto the officers.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
We charge you, in God's name, and the King of York.

MERCUTIO:
I'll go with you to the officers.

ROMEO:
That will be well: go with
====================
ROMEO:
Hie thee to the lane's end:
Stay not, reply not, do not,
Laid me, by the holy rood, but answer not;
No, nor a man comesophero Sly.

MARCIUS:
Let them hang: the balk logic of their
will, and let them hang.

Second Gentleman:
Now death's snatch; take the prisoner.

MARCIUS:
O, hang 'em!
The bourners, I'll give thee more:
These are the words of heaven, utter them.

First Gentleman:
You are paid to do me this good:
I have been a bawd, but you are
An open bawd, and you hang 'em!

LADY CAPULET:
The bawd, the bawd, take it!

MARCIUS:
No, the bawd; you must go to the lane's end:
Look, here's no sign of life, to end.


====================
ROMEO:
My lord, they say we are true; and thou,
That love which thou hast vow'd is false.

LADY CAPULET:
That love, thou talk'st of Juliet,
Doth love, in thy talk of Juliet,
To have her match'd: and there she doth love;
She will not, she gives her love.

JULIET:
If not, I'll not, I'll not be gone.
But, soft! honest gentleman,
To tire your royalty, with whom, I see,
Her greatest downfall.

Nurse:
Then let my dam, and take her,
To have her match'd: in her best array,
She will not be hit with her fair.

LADY CAPULET:
What, in a month, may it please you?

Nurse:
Hold, hold! hold, hold! while you play a merchant's fool,
And venture madly on a desperate mart.

LADY CAPULET:
====================
ROMEO:
Good morning!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
A thousand times good night!

ISABELLA:
What, shall become of me?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
A thousand times good night!
Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from
their books,
But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.

ISABELLA:
Hist! O, let me have my books!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No, not a whit: a race or two of ginger,
Which I by a race divine perfection govern'd.

ISABELLA:
Hist! O, let me have a cup of wine.
A wanton's nose, a very bitter frowning,
That hath received an alms! I will not to the time
But sit me long. A thousand times in the morning
Beveloped and blindfold too long ere long ago.
Delay this bottle of mine. Doff this habit, shame to you,
How
====================
ROMEO:
The good old man is repaid with thanks;
The youngest daughter of the prince your son.

LADY CAPULET:
And, brother Capulet, I'll bear thy blame:
You hear me namely, and tell me what man
Camillo have in esteem at such rate
As may beseem a monarch.

Nurse:
I am his highness' pleasure.

CAPULET:
Why, then you are not honest:
You are not honest, but temperate as you are;
Your son being king, and not King of Wales,
As King Edward is at English feasts, King Edward,
Although King Edward be his subject?

Nurse:
Ay, it is his pleasure.

CAPULET:
Why, he is in arms.

Nurse:
Go, fool, and go with him.

LADY CAPULET:
Go, fool, I say, and go with me.

CAPULET:
Content you
====================
ROMEO:
No, no, but you two; for, as you are
An ancient gentleman, of much licence in virtue,
To have him worthy blame, which shall not
Be blamed for't, but you as the cause.

ISABELLA:
Why, what's your name?

ANGELO:
Tut, as the name is, let me have
Some harlot's name to't.

ISABELLA:
I am the very pink of courtesy, and most accursed
To bitterest of a gentlewoman;
Too noble for use of such a greeting
As lovers' fingers: or, of such delicate touch,
As is the coal in the sea, the fire out
Whose enmity: and, sure, it looks,
With maids whose bodies are dedicate,
To thy divine task task! And, if thy mind be anger,
Behold this single fight with the county.

ISABELLA:
O, full of the meaning!
The ditty does remember me, how I bear
====================
ROMEO:
Come, go, Cleomenes; and with all speed
To Doctor Shaw; poison'd, toad, all lunatic;
To move this marriage; let me live.
Tell me, how fares the friar?
Master, how fares our poor prisoner?

BRAKENBURY:
Very well: let him be sent.

BRAKENBURY:
He dreads his wife, say I.

BRAKENBURY:
You wonder, sir, he doth court my love:
By heaven, I am the fairest of them.

BRAKENBURY:
How lovely maid!

GREMIO:
What is your will, sir, that you must love?

PETRUCHIO:
No, I mean not her; for she hath a pretty catch.

TRANIO:
A crack, madam; I will not love her.

PETRUCHIO:
And you seeing, when I am a guest guest guest?

====================
ROMEO:
Hush, grief,
And fear, not talk, beg one word.

CORIOLANUS:
Thou chafe me, heart!
I am too young to be your son.

CORIOLANUS:
A wisdom, daughter, and you good house too.

MENENIUS:
More than I deserve:
You have with me take my leave.

CORIOLANUS:
You were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise
By all external warrants, and the nobility
Of the worthy gentleman, whom, I see,
I do with the gods sent to see the peace.

AUFIDIUS:
I thank you, general; sweet sir, to you all:
But, to all the rest of you and me, of all
In wholesome coffers, and furnishables, of worthy men
Committed their grave before and to move
Your bastardy not to use me for your own turn.

CORIOLANUS:
What were you snarling?
====================
ROMEO:
But now I promise you,
The next degree is for my mistress.

BUCKINGHAM:
Ay, and I am all frail too.

GLOUCESTER:
'Tis so: farewell, good fellow.

BUCKINGHAM:
To you, the next degree is to venge.

GLOUCESTER:
I go, fellow, to you, and I'll go
To London on a serious matter of care.

BUCKINGHAM:
Hathings, ha? hath God in thy heart but heart?
Well, well, but not for a month,
And not an hour, as it were far off,
But a moiety. Why, then, thy news is very fair.
Farewell, faint-hearted wife, farewell!

LADY ANNE:
Farewell, faint-hearted wife, farewell!

GLOUCESTER:
Stand away, Richard; I must go with you.

LADY ANNE:
====================
ROMEO:
O, let us go: fresh horses!
And yet no more ado.

BENVOLIO:
This gentleman, Romeo,--Hold, Tybalt; thou art a lion.

ROMEO:
Let us take the horse unto Long-lane end;
Spurr'd by the stroke of death;
And then we mean to shift our bush;
Which, as they say, did sowl a nest of kings.

BENVOLIO:
O, he's a lamb.

ROMEO:
Do you hear how he fares? He's a lamb.

BENVOLIO:
Where is he?

ROMEO:
Nay, come, Benvolio; tell me that he bears the gout.

BENVOLIO:
Come, sirrah, come hither: good night, good night.
This night our wits faint.

ROMEO:
Good night! Come, gentle night.

BENVOLIO:
O, bide
====================
ROMEO:
You have had more beard to beard,
And yet your head not to cheeks,
But, look up, you, here is my hand.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Nay, bear it hence: the sin hath not been
To harder bosoms! love but love to hate;
Too soft, too inexorable, and not rude,
Plaid'st before the truth of it.

GREGORY:
What tongueless blocks I have,
To stop the senseless rushes?

SAMPSON:
No, gracious lord,--God forbid my heart flies through these unreverent robes
Which once inhabit, and I am gone.

SAMPSON:
I have lived to see inherited my very wishes
And still my eyes upon my head.

SAMPSON:
A thousand times good days.

SAMPSON:
And I mean well in going to this mask;
But, for I am a gentleman,
And one that scorn to scorn at your extremes,

====================
ROMEO:
I took this mercy; and, in his view,
Depop not from this shame.

PETRUCHIO:
Be plainer, Kate.

GLOUCESTER:
My noble lord,
When I was last in Holborn,
My lands then in this land.

LADY CAPULET:
So stood it for you?

PETRUCHIO:
A witty widow? witless else her fortune,
To make her widow.

PETRUCHIO:
A most modest and as true;
She, as it were far off sound thou art,
Should be your highness' recompense.

JULIET:
Nay, you mean, sweet sir, and you my
favour upon her.

PETRUCHIO:
Hark, Kate; I will not go to-day;
I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday next.

BAPULET:
Was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly
====================
ROMEO:
Nay, come away:
I hope he grows not in tune.
Now let me have a month behind,
In the preferment of a tavern,
To cut off their suits, for all
My master's use! Tell me, good old Gremio,
What say you to my master? To leave frivolous circumstances,
And, to save your life,--fend it, God send
A better guiding peace.
You have a thousand thin and willing swords:
You will think a little of that,
And not delay, to find a person any other but
Death to thy master. Do me thy hand:
Under which heavy arms shall Romeo bear?

Second Gentleman:
Hold, there's my hand:
Hold me his long sword, and do the knight
To swear him in the justice of his cause.

LUCIO:
O, do me double wrong, and make known
Which way thou liest! O, revenges his wrongs!

First Gentleman:
Where is that devilish-raven, that murderer
====================
ROMEO:
What, ho! slave, woman, you slug-a-a-tart! you whoreson-a-a-day! you whoreson-a-a-day! you whoreson-a-a-day! you whoreson-a-a-day!
a-day! you whoreson-a-day! you whoreson-day!
Was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly?
You whoreson'st on? What, ho! your whoreson-a-day!
Was ever woman in this humour won?
Was ever woman in this humour won?
I'll have her; I'll have her: the times is gone, I trow her;
And once again. I'll have her; I'll have her;
But never again.

Nurse:
I have no cause to be mad:
Madam, we can; I'll have no cause to be mad.

JULIET:
She shall be mad:
But God send to her--
God send her joy!
Ah, poor babe, an you'll not

ROMEO:
What, ho! my head, my tongue! My heart!
I'll not be gone till I am lost.

KING EDWARD IV:
Then sways it your way, my sovereign.

KING EDWARD IV:
Sister, content you in what?

KING EDWARD IV:
No, gracious lord, except I cannot love.

LADY GREY:
I would with all attainder of a king,
And I for his good escape.

KING EDWARD IV:
Why, then, God will not be a high?

LADY GREY:
Away with her, but love her, and quiet,
To make a kissing with her.

KING EDWARD IV:
I will with you, sweet lord.

LADY GREY:
And, so I take my leave,--

KING EDWARD IV:
Sweet saint, I fear thy love to thee--

LADY GREY:
And, sweet saint, thou

ROMEO:
I would be found out of the church.
I tell thee, sith it is; search about the churchyard:
Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.

First Penkerchief;
All eyes gaze on the new-made king's head.

Lord Mayor:
Is it so? hark, what noise?
Hark, who calls your beauteous cry?
An you be mine, ha? ha! put me in:
Crowns in my purse I have and goods at your hands.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
God bless your grace! ha! and farewell all, good fellow.
To you and yours, good fellow Curtis.

DUKE OF YORK:
There, at Saint Alban's field-corner,
This lady's wife, Sir Richard Grey, in Saint Alban's field,
This lady's mildness, Sir Richard Grey, in Saint Alban's field,
And in Saint Alban's field, they in

ROMEO:
I am a happy bawd, and go with me.

TRANIO:
So would you be again, as thou know me.

PETRUCHIO:
'Tis true, sir.

LUCENTIO:
So will you, sir? But, as you guess,
You guess, that you may beBIANCA:
If he be leaden, go with me.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, let me go.
I tell you, sirrah, what says the wench?

HORTENSIO:
Your wife, sirrah, is a happily woman;
She is but a hot brain, as you guess?

PETRUCHIO:
Well, sir, it is no little thing to be.

PETRUCHIO:
I do believe a little.

PETRUCHIO:
And, sir, it is no little thing to be mad.

HORTENSIO:
'Tis well
====================
ROMEO:
I warrant him.

MARCIUS:
I shall assure thee, if he give me.
This is his house; give't thee, choose it orderly.

COMINIUS:
If he inclin and way it not too harily,
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, sure-a-tale, nor a man
That does affect it.

MARCIUS:
There's thy noble house.

COMINIUS:
Go, then.
And,Worthy Cominius, this does know our purpose.

MARCIUS:
I am his house within this hour,
Whom he ports and where the noble senate
Even upon Cominius, scarce they
Washed their power i' the lowest and but attended
In high despite of the house of Rome,--
With honours like himself,--Cullus, I
Worthy Cominius, renowned Coriolanus!
And, to break our heart's heart for that
Which we in
====================
ROMEO:
It is my fault, to have
Some unaccustom'd offence.

LADY CAPULET:
It is my fault that you have touch'd your eyes:
You understand me, sir?

JULIET:
I have, sir, in my life.

LADY CAPULET:
You'll not speak with me.

JULIET:
You shall not.

LADY CAPULET:
O, Godless coward! O God!--O earth, how we
Shalt have good old folks! But who's there?

JULIET:
This is some: mistake, in God's name,
The constable, and the haught in't,
No man knows whither. You, sirrah vouchsafe to wear a crown,
And give it to an unstanched crown.
A crown it is; which long a long-warr'd king
Is now upon my head.
What, do you wring your hands in the ground?
====================
ROMEO:
How now, Claudio! whence came you hither?

Servant:
By this, sir, I am here.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
By this reckoning he is more than you expect.

Provost:
Ay, and that thou expect'st not nothing but
himself.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
And, by great Lord of
Master Vincentio, at Saint Peter's field,
Stands betwixt the Duke of England and himself,
And sent according to command the Duke of York.

Provost:
What, is the duke gone?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No, no.

Provost:
His head is but a very weak and as
As may tie the beard to the beard,
And wear it as a knave's officer.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Why, then it is no more.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Why, then
====================
ROMEO:
Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
Some patient leisure to excuse myself.

LADY CAPULET:
Fouler than tongue can think thee, thou canst make
No excuse current, but to hang thy heart.

JULIET:
By such despair, I should accuse myself.

LADY CAPULET:
And, by despairing, shouldst thou stand excused;
For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,
Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others.

JULIET:
Say, he slew them not?

Nurse:
He did them not kill your husband.

JULIET:
Why, then they are not dead:
But dead they are, and devilish slaveish slave, by thee.

Nurse:
I did not kill your husband.

JULIET:
I grant me, and he shall do it.

Nurse:
I grant me, daughter: you shall not
====================
ROMEO:
My lord, my lord, he shall be Vincentio; go with me.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, let us go: I'll try this widow's wit.

PETRUCHIO:
First kiss me, Kate, and we will.

BAPTISTA:
Son of Kate, with my countenance in your delight?

PETRUCHIO:
What, Kate? let her away:
Her name is Kate; and her dower is not Kate.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, let her not go:
Her name is Kate, and I am not Kate;
I am but a gentleman and one that scorn to you.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, you are not, sir; and one that scorn to you.

GREMIO:
You are too blunt: go with me to the lane's end;
Do you hear me swear I'll not be Kate;
I am no gentleman of a gentleman.

PETR
====================
ROMEO:
No, Bolingbroke: you say nothing.

LADY GREY:
O, full as dearly as I love myself.

LADY GREY:
Full as dearly as I love myself.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
But is it true?

LADY GREY:
Here, if you love me.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I do assure you, father, 'tis true.

LADY GREY:
Well, go with me.

LADY GREY:
Then, if you love me.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You mean, sir, to have her fair love.

LADY GREY:
That is the love I bear thee.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Hath he so grieved as he?

LADY GREY:
Ay, full as dearly as I love myself.

DUKE V
====================
ROMEO:
This is strange. He must die,
Lest his death to-night, before his burial.

PETRUCHIO:
The fairer than tongue can name thee fickle:
By such despair, I wish it go.

PETRUCHIO:
The fairer than tongue can name thee fickle;
And it is heart that calls for company to-night.

BUCKINGHAM:
Why, sir, what's your conceit in that?

PETRUCHIO:
Sir, the conceit is but to be wild, and wild,
That calls for company to-morrow morning:
If company be rough with the business,
Obey, call me fickle; if the hangman.

GREMIO:
The business is fairer than tongue can name thee,
And gentlewoman wear it.

PETRUCHIO:
Hark, Petruchio; I do fain say,
That if thou be fickle, keep my kites.

====================
ROMEO:
The time shall not, between twelve and now.

Provost:
My lord, here's such ado as this.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Where is the provost?

Provost:
Here, sir.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Where is the provost?

Provost:
Here, sir.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Provost, here, sir. here, you logger-headed.
Now, sirrah, where is the provost? is this within?

Provost:
Here, sirrah; here, sir.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You logger-headed and unpolish'd grooms!
Did I not bid thee walk abroad?

Provost:
Here, sirrah; here, sirrah.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, do I fear 'tis charity.
What, ho! Abhappily, my lord! I
====================
ROMEO:
What, ho! my manhood is a very goodly gift.

LADY CAPULET:
What is't?

JULIET:
It is an honour that doth make thee give.

LADY CAPULET:
I am not well fain to be young;
But yet, as it were far off sound thou Lord of Gloucester,
To give me notice of thy coming:
Yet never after I have known thy course.

JULIET:
No, not a whit: give me leave:
An I have been Gloucester, and Gloucester,
As I come out, to do the good upon me,
I have a kinsman to put my Gloucester out:
And, Gloucester, to Lancaster in post,
Stays but the summons of the appellant's trumpet.

Nurse:
My lord, the summons of this is the day:
You promised us two days a day's journey.

LADY CAPULET:
We will descend and fold
====================
ROMEO:
No man knows whither.

ROMEO:
You cry a match.

JULIET:
Nay, match not.

ROMEO:
How, happy dog!
With love's light wings I will love thee.
Love, loath love, in thy look I see
The happy issue of a direful looking-for hate;
A thousand times to wash a fair one
And give thee more than I meant to hate thee.

JULIET:
O, full as dearly as sweet as is the fruit.

ROMEO:
The sweetest fruit first falls, and so doth she;
The meanest time craves access to your bed.
What say'st thou? hast thou not a mind of her care?
Then know, that I am in forsworn by her:
Farewell, farewell; I have no cause to be much sad:
Commend me to thy lady and my wife.

JULIET:
I'll not go to the lane's
====================
ROMEO:
Good father, adieu; I have no cause to seek.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
We are merely cheated of our country's law,
For perpetuity, and for thy therein therein therein.

MARCIUS:
You have been a fool to us all,
That lack no reason.

ANGELO:
Let us in safety, where lies our Juliet?

MARCIUS:
Let us in safety, where we are leonted,
As may beseeming the spouse of the wars.

ANGELO:
Now, good my lord,--

MARCIUS:
We are true subjects to our proceedings,
And that the safe safety of the our country,
The safety of the persons, and our persons' safety,
The safety of the persons' safety, and our persons' safety,
As the safety of our persons' safety,
Thurs on our knees, and no grounded malice in ourselves;
No use of metal, corn, or oil, or oil;

====================
ROMEO:
Sir, induced by my charity, and hearing how hastily
I have borne this business.
Upon my head, I charge you,--

ISABELLA:
May it please you, sir, to grant it lawful suit;
It were no sin at all,
But charity to save that sin, which you have
Been his high blood.

ANGELO:
I do arrest your office, and do arrest your good
Some hour in your execution.

ISABELLA:
O, that your office may be do you office,
Be do you office, like the good;
To be your comforle, do your office
To have your just censure.

ANGELO:
May it please you, sir, to do this kind service.

ISABELLA:
May it please your highness to do it,
It were no less. Please your highness to do this kind service,
Be do it with your knees, and with your breath,
Or with the clamour keep your just
====================
ROMEO:
What, did my father that went with him?

BUCKINGHAM:
No, madam; yet, methinks, it was.

PETRUCHIO:
Hastings, indeed. Who, that did this,
Thy father, that holp to send him thither;
And presently repair to Crosby Place;
Where, after I haveWWorthy Cominius, like a brace
Should atone you enter butcheries,
Hath very weak guard his royal tent,
And prove him, in defending of yourselves.

PETRUCHIO:
What is your name? and wherefore gaze this,
As if the justice did her wrong?
O, let us go: honest, honest!
The fault's your part, and the remedy.

PETRUCHIO:
O, let us go: the fault's come before it.
I'll try how you can find the man.

BAPTISTA:
Where can you find him? you are welcome.


====================
ROMEO:
I'll see thee walk again:
Banish her, marry her!

BENVOLIO:
A thousand times good night!
Would I were married to a king.

ROMEO:
The times that brought your husband to the door
Had not been slaughter-house, and the manner of death
Had been too sudden: I lost a couple of kinsmen
And then I fall'd unto the officers.
Where have I been? I long before saw Romeo's last,
And Montague, my poor self, Romeo,
Sigh'd my but his passion, when I was at Mantua,
I bear a man to chide at thy heart,
And takest thy hope in thy death, going in the dregs
Of the same kindred of the Prince.
Thus hath the course of justice wheel'd about,
And led the reckless executioner toward the plain.
Lord'st thou his hell-black peril?
What's it? hath he done to this untimely shame?
And what's it? hath he done to this shame?
====================
ROMEO:
Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
Some patient leisure to excuse myself.

HORTENSIO:
Fouler than tongue can think thee, thou canst make
No excuse current, but to hang thyself.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
By such despair, I should accuse myself.

PETRUCHIO:
And, by despairing, shouldst thou stand excused;
For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,
Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others.

BIONDELLO:
Say that I slew them not?

PETRUCHIO:
Why, then they are not dead:
I did not kill your husband.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, then he is alive.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, he is dead; and slain by Edward's hand.

BIONDELLO:
In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw
Thy murderous falchion smoking in
====================
ROMEO:
'Tis a little fouler than tongue can name thee.

LADY CAPULET:
Tush, defused infection, and more than needful;
To cure this worm, which is no greater.

LADY CAPULET:
Go, get thee gone, thou false deluding slave,
That feed upon this earth's earth,
To rend it in the fire out; for thou shalt not come;
For thou shalt never come before thou hast more cause
To prattle for thee and her all the pack of you.

JULIET:
O God!--O nurse, how now! who calls so your grace?
The night-tide night, the noon-tide night,
Make the dim night look pale: your eyes do menace me
With so heavy weight that look upon me.
Ill blows your golden beams on this wretch,
And, if you be not, lead; I'll put you to the hell,
Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
In braving arms against my heart.
====================
ROMEO:
O wonderful, and full of heart's heavy heart:
The thought of this, but to be wary,
Left solely heir to the crown and reign as king.

KING RICHARD II:
My crown I am; but the last leave
Is,--thou'rt a kingdom; and full of grief,
It is the rarest thing about I hate.

KING RICHARD II:
Why, then, the rest stand still.

KING RICHARD II:
Cousin, farewell; I must not say how much.

NORFOLK:
My gracious lord,--

KING RICHARD II:
Cousin, farewell; I must not say no more.

NORFOLK:
Anon, my most gracious lord,
To go with me unto the officers.

KING RICHARD II:
Cousin, farewell: what presence must not know,
From where you have been.

NORFOLK:
My gracious lord,--
====================
ROMEO:
No, I'll not hence, for I have begun to strike
Upon a hill, till my tale be out.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Northumberland, I hold thee reverently.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
In love?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Northumberland, so lovel'st thou, God ye godheth.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My love sprung on my head, and I would not stay.

KING EDWARD IV:
No, madam, except I cannot brook delay:
I have no cause to mourn but hate,
And would have have have have have cut off a root of root.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers;
I bear no pity to live a king.

KING EDWARD IV:
But, being seated as King Edward is King Edward's,
It must needs needs needs needs be great unto the crown.


====================
ROMEO:
Hush, thou know'st, hath set me in thy bed:
Confirm it in thy chamber, for thou shalt be the watch.
Farewell, old Gremio; go along with me.

LADY GREY:
Am I like you, sir? at this instant I'll desire.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, well, sir, in brief, and in brief, sir, I am a gentleman.

LADY GREY:
And, to be noted for a day or two;
That shall, I know, is very uneven.

PETRUCHIO:
O, sir, well, to be noted for a day.

GREY:
And as for you, sir, as I may now,
I have been very mean a subject for you;
That shall, at the instant of your loving motion,
Be determined at what you will,
And at what hour my time deliver.

PETRUCHIO:
A gentleman! And, sir, well met
====================
ROMEO:
The appellant in arms must not have his cause.

LADY CAPULET:
Merely, because his cause is now
Which plats the root and hangs in his hand.

First Keeper:
Wherefore? wherefore? wherefore?
The kites builds his car upon his way,
To pluck him heir out of danger.

CAPULET:
Where is this viper
That would depopulate his father's wife?
You tell me, as for the brat of his awaking:
You, my noble cousin king, shall soon at know
What way the way himself doth with the king!

LADY CAPULET:
Will not the king begin to woo his daughter?

CAPULET:
Ay, that same pale hard-hearted wench,
That would divorce this happy land.

LADY CAPULET:
I shall not live.

CAPULET:
Uncle, give me leave:
May it please your highness
====================
ROMEO:
I will do what thou canst not,
Lest that thy heart with ingots.

GLOUCESTER:
What, not a whit for me?

BRAKENBURY:
I will for you: you, gentle cousin,
That did your heart but hate, in me,
That bottled spider-took up the cave,
With loathsome smells, will not move me further
Than of old folks or newer torture, to take up,
By any ungot. But, good cousin, God and God,
What says King Edward to this princely denier?

BRAKENBURY:
Right, then, to princely denier.

GLOUCESTER:
What says he?

BRAKENBURY:
You will not sit there.

GLOUCESTER:
Go to, go to; the duke will not be here.
You, that kill King Edward's man!
You, that kill King Edward's friend,
To go
====================
ROMEO:
I go, anon.--

Do, good my lord, lest I land the seas be
A all-hath; and,--I take my leave,
To go with you unto the officers.

GONZALO:
You shall.

PAGE:
Thou chid'st me, Aufidius; I shall not go:
And therefore, setting all this toward.
What is yond matter? Be gone, beseech you.

GONZALO:
A goodly city is this Antium. City,
'Tis, my mother; but I'll sort occasion in this
church. The citizens are this city, I know, they're
not--I know not--GonZALO: get you gone, you consenting to the wars
tide the city. Your people'st o' the people's eyes,
persuade the gods look down and shake them back again,
in the same sense; I will not home to-night.

ROMEO:
I am too young for the world: and, but it were I
will watch.

But 'tis grown upon a day.

LADY CAPULET:

BIONDELLO:
The same, sir.

Where is he?

BIONDELLO:
Here, sir.

PETRUCHIO:
Here, sir.

PETRUCHIO:
Now, sir, here, sir.

BIONDELLO:
Now, sir, you mean not as well as I do: but, as you
shall know, you mean not as you do: but as you
shall know, you mean not as I do, yet that I am
as young as is this night, if I be not young: let
you come to dinner.

TRANIO:
Sir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well.

ROMEO:
I know it well.

BUCKINGHAM:
Tut, I can tell you, hath a son for me.

GLOUCESTER:
I have, my lord, for a while we have known.

BUCKINGHAM:
Who knows not that?

GLOUCESTER:
Thou, that toucheth us in thy choice,
To go with Paris: Saint George to Saint George!

BUCKINGHAM:
I saw your dumbness in your dumbness' face,
And withal most suspected, as it is,
To torture, in the quarrel since it came,
To vex your royal self.

KING EDWARD IV:
What, do you quarrel, if he speak of God?

GLOUCESTER:
He cannot speak of that: God will revenge it.

KING EDWARD IV:
What, do you quarrel, if he speak of God?

GLOUCESTER:
No, gracious lord, no;

ROMEO:
O, pardon me, my lord, I'll pardon you:
But, as I know, my lord, my name is tickle-a.

Nurse:
Your highness shall do well to grant her suit;
It were no better: I am a gloveless coward,
More than a glove that looks upon my head.

PETRUCHIO:
You are no beast.

Nurse:
O wonderful, and as a thing.

PETRUCHIO:
But I am a beast, and I am too.

Nurse:
Am I the beast? O wonderful, I am
The lamb of all the sea, that I bade thee.

PETRUCHIO:
Hark, how they roar! whoa-wolf o'er the sea!
That feed my young men in the bottom of the air,
Whose manners still my court-councils in the bottom of my sorrow,
Sitting in the bottom of my griefs, thy tongue,

Nay, bear the knave by the volume.

Was ever book containing such a subject as
This seems to bear?

SAMPSON:
My name is Romeo; my dwelling Pisa;
The only son of the great enemy
That hath moved me to commit; therefore follow'd
Upon his passion: let him not spend a hour,
For then he promised me a duke of duke.

GREMIO:
At the highest, sir; and, for my poor self,
To be a duke of those enemies.

SAMPSON:
At the top; whereof, at the lower end of this hall,
We'll enter again.

GREMIO:
At the top; and,--God rest! Now will I sit under a medlar tree,
A root of draymen's woe! Will you pluck your sword out of me?
And say you do not know

ROMEO:
O, let me live: he must die to-night
And see her, for then her recovery.

FRIAR JOHN:
Be-bed, then.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Be-bed, then.

PETRUCHIO:
Hark, how they kiss! Who wants thee, devil,
That respites me that I sent before to the monument.
Obey, and go along, Kate, and prepare for this desperate man!

BRAKENBURY:
Be-bited, go, and go with us; prepare for the watch.
Obey, and go; for, hence!
Obey, and be not angry, go, be angry, do not trouble us!
Nay, mark how they kiss and court! What, do not push
Obey, and be a-catcher, and fill all about,
Hold up thy spirits; thou dost not move.

LADY CAPULET:
Good lady! God give you joy, effect this strife:
I'll make all haste, to Saint George's field,
Where, the Earl of Wiltshire is Earl of Wiltshire;
That, upon Saint George's field, we'll enter
The Thracian wars with the humorous night.

NORFOLK:
Now, brother Richard, will you go with us?

LADY CAPULET:
Ay, full as dearly as I thought you did;
That you, my tender George of Clarence,
His lands then seized on by the conqueror:
And now in England he shalt find his well-chasing dreams.

KING EDWARD IV:
What, proud man is't that Henry made
His rescue to England?

Such war hath never broken in war.

She will not stir; she shall not stir her.

You shall, your father's. God forgive me,
You shall not stir her out.

Second Gentleman:
Here is the county; in the sty of this foot-path,
And no man knows whither.

Unless you use to report a mannerleman:
Do, good old fool, with whom, I know,
Thus doth a young gentleman
To be his wife, but he of teeth teeth,
And in the view of ever angry humour,
Be lamb-tattling,--Hark you, sirrah; I am a gentleman.

I am at Mantua.

Provost:
You shall find me both.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
There shall no figure at all
The figure of a man; and as much hair
As meaner to countenance the hat and rude hand.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No figure at all, but a certainty.
Yet let us go together, if we aim occasion,
The truth of our quarrel: yet we may blow it on
the right hand, and at thy face.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What is this?

Provost:
Now the matter?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
'Tis a. Look, signior, the for thy life:
'Tis a very tricking, to take thy life:
wouldst thou wert so foolish as is the bud.

Provost:
The sun, the sun!

ROMEO:
It is your pleasure, sir, to undertake the death of
Your joys discontented father.

MARCIUS:
I will, my lord.

MARCIUS:
I'll carry no matter.

MARCIUS:
Let us have very little work, for our short friends repair.

MARCIUS:
Let's hear.

ANGELO:
What's the matter?

MARCIUS:
MARCIUS:
That our garments are not furnish'd
With rich subsidies and made
With too great sums of charge.

ANGELO:
What's the matter?

MARCIUS:
Now, what's the matter?

ANGELO:
I am an ill-favoury,--Bohemia's wife,
The worthy gentleman did lose his life
And lands thy body in Corioli like an unnatural dam:
And here he lives again to honour Coriolanus.

MARCIUS:
All but
====================
ROMEO:
I saw no man speak: give me his name
Some word before his last in his country.

CAMILLO:
I saw him arrested him; he arrested him not,
But it was his own.

FLO:
But, worthy Camillo,
No.

CAMILLO:
Sir, it is a spell, what you saw him arrested,
Not something spake with the penitent.

FLO:
No, sir, your tapster is grown too hot.
What colour for what?

CAMILLO:
Sent by theSent you home.

FLO:
Sent by Camillo,--
But o'er his word, my faith, I saw
Camillo's arrested and carried it myself;
But, with his last attempt he did escape
To the officer.

CAMILLO:
Sir, it were no great matter;
I would attach you.

FLORIZEL:
No, sir, but you
====================
ROMEO:
I am the best of them.

PETRUCHIO:
God's is the matter. The happier for thy love
companions are to be thy servitor,
And most obedient; and most obedient
To what's past, go thy heart:
Take thy thy last embrace; commend me to
A better fit the time to come.

PETRUCHIO:
Gentlemen, take up the corse.

KATHARINA:
Away! the kinsman's out.

PETRUCHIO:
Come, Kate, I'll out of doors.

KATHARINA:
So, Kate; I will not over the city.

PETRUCHIO:
What, up? down, and down again.
Nay, get you gone.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, come, Kate; I must not come down.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, get you gone.
There is a wench in

ROMEO:
No, gracious lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sir, at your pleasure, madam.

MARCIUS:
May it please you to fall into so,
Ere you lose it. Prithee, Virgilia,
The great Apollo suddenly will have
The truth of this appear. Prepare you, lords; kneel you
To call us the officers.
You that durst swear at your mistress' house,
May call us the officers o' the officers.
In these our days he was met with our royal fleet.

MARCIUS:
I shall, my lord.

MARCIUS:
Yonder'st o' the city, and that the good city
Be assish'd upon before you come. You, Titus Lartius,
Must to Corioli back: send us to Rome,
Or never to Rome. Have you wars:
Marcius, his wife, and Titus Lartius,
Shalt have a wars of civil wars,
Which honour and whose gratitude and whose

ROMEO:
I must love thee, thou choler, coward, for thou know'st
th not the fish, but the sea,--he dropp'd it,
he killed thy master.

CURTIS:
No, nor a man.

ARCHBISHOP OF CARLISLE:
Why, then thou didst not kill your husband.

CURTIS:
Why, then thou mean'st a very little.

ARCHBISHOP OF CARLISLE:
Why, then, he doth not.

CURTIS:
I mean, an I'll fill the world with those giglots:
which time it is, would you not kill your husband?

ARCHBISHOP OF CARLISLE:
Ay, by Saint Paul, from Saint Paul.

PAULINA:
I pray you, sir, come hither.
Now, by Saint Paul, tell me your mind:
The thought of my poor opinion, but still my love:
There's my joy,
====================
ROMEO:
What, do you hear me swear at this feast?

CATESBY:
I shall, my lord.

GLOUCESTER:
I swear at all respects to God's good cause,
To go with me unto the officers.

HASTINGS:
And Hastings, and Montague,
Stands at Saint Alban's field, as they say,
Stabb'd in the main battle, and tired of retire,
Which Saint Alban's priest and that prince,
Which in the Christian climate I have sworn to God,
That I in justice cannot well descant.

GLOUCESTER:
You shall wellow my hate:
But since I come to your hate,
The issue of your love to me, your fair Bianca,
To come at traitors' calls and beat my love down.
I shall your love to me, go with me:
Too well you deserve well to have a lusty widow;
And better it is to wear a maid's gown;
Too well for your hands and your hands.
====================
ROMEO:
Banish'd you the cause?

LADY CAPULET:
I cannot speak: God help Montague,
His honour in't that knows the cause.

Nurse:
Anon, his royal father!

Nurse:
My noble uncle,--God hold you dear to him--
And, brother Montague, know you not any,
An if my cousin's love were on aught therein in me.
Anon comes one that, at last I spied for you;
Taste of our fair looks, and therefore look not pale.
Here is the county's page: search about the churchyard:
Go, some of the men, who, newly in the entertainment,
I find my zenithith, the churchyard is well stored.
What's his name?

Nurse:
Lucentio, gentlewoman, well approved in all;
Happily we met; the happier for thy son.
And now by law, as well as reverend age,
I may entitle thee my loving father:
====================
ROMEO:
The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,
Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,
Exempt from those that look upon him.
Hark you, night-harked sleep; peace and rest the night,
And, as they say, that you have been so baked
With gentle conference, is all this isle.
You, my lord, to have a lusty cause to wail
That it should leave me: I have a cause
To think upon my faults, which shall, with such grace,
Forthwith the stroke of four.
You, my lord, will not go to the lane's end:
Think upon me, think upon me.
Upon my head, go before me again:
You precious winners all the world, my lord,
That I, your love, which I dearly love,
Lament till you have no cause to be much believed,
I am your butt,--God rest you from me!
You, my lord, to have some cause to wail thy heart,
Where I should complain I have
====================
ROMEO:
No, for then we pardon. Alas, this gentleman,
Whom I would save, had been a gentleman
Visit'd his country: he,wing'd, hath lost his country
Destroy'd his country with full contempt
And given him deputation all his lands.

CORIOLANUS:
Where is this fellow?

MENENIUS:
Here, this fellow.

CORIOLANUS:
You worthy fellow, you noble fellow:
Whom I honour and I hate, for I thy
s brother Coriolanus, being three quarters
Great Rome, and of worthy birth;
Laiest his land then known to the Capitol;
Which well appeared in Rome, and his fortunes
Cerved in this action,--Caius Marcius, lead! Now, good city,
What goodman you in all, that you shall hate,
That shall be hate to you for him
And hate to you for Rome, that you may well
Till you hate him for his country.

CORIOLANUS:
====================
ROMEO:
And yet I come not well.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You do me wrong, grave sir.

LUCIO:
Do you hear, manifest you this speech, for you have purpose,
To use your just ordinance to this garden,
Or use your just ordinance to the garden,
Or perish in the sexton's garden,
As thou shalt think, forty-five pound;
Which, as it were far off, did violence
By Edward's good marriage, dishonour'd by his dishonour,
Which craves as the noble duke hath,
It were no less; and, as it were far off,
To kill your Edward, the King of heaven,
The worthy gentleman, Lord Hastings, and Lord Grey,
With all the nearest things to the Duke of Gloucester,
Charged our main battle's front, and breaking in
Were by the swords of common soldiers slain.

KING EDWARD IV:
Marshal, demand of yonder champion
The cause of his arrival here in arms:
Ask him his

ROMEO:
No, my good lord,--I must not say, my lord;
Too good, and better 'good' to be something rare,
Than' for any man that knows the cause.

PETRUCHIO:
What, wilt thou go? Take good Camillo's head.

Second Messenger:
Sirrah, I will not trouble you.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, my sweet wife, I will not dance.

LUCENTIO:
What, not a word? Nay, then you mean not.

PETRUCHIO:
I mean, my wife.

PETRUCHIO:
A thousand times at least.

LUCENTIO:
And, 'twill make me think the world is full.
How now! which is your wife?

PETRUCHIO:
She is, and has a face of her own.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, well, put up your sword.

====================
ROMEO:
If I love thy company, go on
the streets, obey me.

Citizens:
How many children hast thou, widow? tell me.

Citizens:
Three, as they say: most hate them.

Citizens:
Make thee speak, they say.

Citizens:
Do you hear, or are you sure of met.

Citizens:
Sir, hear you.

Citizens:
You are well met.

MENENIUS:
And shall?

Citizens:
I must.

MENENIUS:
I shall, between this and supper.

Citizens:
You are looked for and abused.

MENENIUS:
Be-tock the modest moon!

Citizens:
I will be angry.

MENENIUS:
Bid me leave these sad things,
Or make me gape at the moon.

Citizens:

ROMEO:
Now, my good lord, what are you?

LADY CAPULET:
A combless beetle.

Nurse:
An you'll make a quarry
With repetition of what we mean to hunt.

Nurse:
Then, God bless you for this!

LADY CAPULET:
I am your bird. What would you adventure
To hunt this wild-catcher in the night?
O, he's the mouse, that hath been so bared
To kill your husband!
O Lord, he's a lamb-cricket! a very gross hag!
He's a lamb, that baes like a bear.
Hilt thou provoke me to some wither'd bough and there
My mate, that lives like a cravener?
Or shall she kill herself?
O Lord, give me thy hand:
I'll do thee service for a looking-glass,
Or entertain some score me here;
A grave but hollow perjury.

Nurse:
Peter, I
====================
ROMEO:
All tongues, and the earldom of York,
Are from my lips, and my arm,
And, being angry, does forget that ever
I ever did cry out of heaven for this.
Hath yet the souls of men sent the conquer'd?
If not all eyes else once upon the earth doth rage
To enter that fearful times did kill your love.
Then, for these known evils, but to give me leave,
By circumstance, but to acquit myself.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
Some patient leisure to excuse myself.
My brother Gloucester hates the noble duke.
And so his pity me: I'll make a quarry
Withhold revenge upon me, and at all times
Unmity's in quarrel of the two houses of York.
Come, Clarence, come; thou art sworn brother.

LADY GREY:
Brother, well dost not on the knees of death.

GLOUCESTER:
Were I sworn

ROMEO:
And we mean well in going to the lane's end.

BRAKENBURY:
Is't possible, brother?

LADY GREY:
I do assure you, in God's name, and the king.

PETRUCHIO:
It were not done.

PETRUCHIO:
I fear me, sir, you shall not go to the lane's end:
And, if you do cause, go to the lane's end;
But go; the foot-path way; the
path way; the foot-path way; the headlongs of the dog.

PETRUCHIO:
O, go, the horse; the long-lane end;
go, the wall, the long-lane end of the night,
to supper, look sad- sad look sad- sad.

LADY GREY:
I'll see thee hang'd on the highway,
Where ancient folks did hear of horse.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, dry

ROMEO:
Sir, go along, and see the issue.
Masterrah, look how the life be parallel'd
Twenty crowns an hour ago.

LADY CAPULET:
I will, my lord, to Saint Alban's Castle;
Where, at Saint Alban's field, I'll watch thee withal.

GLOUCESTER:
Where, at Saint Alban's Castle straight:
There doth he have ta'en the court; there, at Saint Alban's field,
The knights and gentlemen to come with him,
And knights and gentlemen to enter with him.

GLOUCESTER:
Sirrah, look how the sequel hangs together:
And, look back, defend thee from the fight!

LADY CAPULET:
An it like your good will! But it likes thee well,
Like, of all the complete armour that I encounter'd:
And, back unto thy royal self,--
I beseech you, look back, defend thee from thy fall!

GLOUCESTER:

ROMEO:
I must eat my dinner.

LADY GREY:
Be sure of it, good Grumio.

GRUMIO:
Go, masters, get you home, you fragments!

LADY GREY:
No, to the Capitol; let me look on.

PETRUCHIO:
No, no, Grumio; throw away this dish.

LADY GREY:
Nay, sit by the wall.

PETRUCHIO:
I would they were abed!

PETRUCHIO:
No, I'll not sit there.

PETRUCHIO:
I say well.

PETRUCHIO:

sorrows, their idle body.

Amen.

CAPULET:
And, I beseech you, sir, bethink you, good comfort.

LADY CAPULET:
No, God-den, I beseech you, God sent me not;
I'll pray you, tell me what I say.

CAPULET:
You shall not be my wife; you shall not be her;
I'll not be married; God send you joy!
You shall have me married a wither'd fool,
Or I'll not wed her; you shall pardon me.
You shall have a bastardy choler,
A whining fool, a whining fool, and none of you.

LADY CAPULET:
Talk not to me, tell me that:
You shall deal

That I am a poor fellow,--would you, sir, 'tis yours.

LARTIUS:
Go, fellow, home again.

MARCIUS:
Go, fellow, home again.

MARCIUS:
This same instruments, which you profane, have with a crack'den note,
Hath yielded the very virtue of a man.
Now, this same instruments, which you profane,
Never sound the truth of such men, but do not taste the
Of the man that scorn the noble heart.

His name is Romeo.

Happily he met thee,--
With call'st thou his lastname,
And not the greeting of the time.
What! he was in Mantua, careless as the manner
In that direful murder, as thou art liege,
Lest thou thy mortal drugs to kill thyself?

JULIET:
But is he gracious in the people's eyes,
No, no, no; and more of his offence
Than the rebuke of the poor God.

To go with you back to the north, or,
To find out the best way home.

GLOUCESTER:
No, gracious man:
Dost thou show thy noble heart?

LADY CAPULET:
I would I might thank you, sir.

GLOUCESTER:
I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,
To leave this keen encounter of our wits,
And fall somewhat into a slower method,
Is not the causer of timeless timeless timeless timeless timeless deaths
As they would hang themselves on one crutch'd a guilty day,
And yet the steer, the heifer and the calf,
Who having pinch'd as many millions of currants,
With clogging arms against those hard points
As boldness, and in vain, no doubt, right royal.

on Saint George for Saint George!

Nurse:
And, by Saint Paul, this is a match.

'Tis true. God shall be a choler, if
they be true; for, as they say, she looks sweet.

Hie thee to hell, where thou shalt wish me luck!
And, like dumb statues, take it to thy heart,
Racking the stones of the maids,
And fleer them, whilst they did hear me swear,
Were not incensed by the devil, but to thy love:
And, as I am, I am a gentleman,
Do I remember the favours of Edward's youth.
And, by his fall, did I not bid you mark me,
If I wear it the measure of a month,
Or, by the saint's fall foul act of death,
As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood
Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered!

Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.

No man knows whither. Thou hast nor shall't:
Go, call the watch. What they are here?

That shows a fair looking-glass. Do as thou bid me list

The day is broke; we are not yet.

Where is the county?

GLOUCESTER:
Here, sir; here, I charge you, in Buckingham.

How fares the noble lord?

Sir, to satisfy your grace
To undertake the death of all noble faults,
I do arrest you here.

O, well, he is well: he is well repaid with thanks;
And, well

ROMEO:
Happily we met; the happier for thy son.
The wager which now is Prince of Wales is light in love,
Whose fair queen died, and thy brothers haught and proud,
The true succeeders of this noble house!
The sons of Edward, Beaumond, brothers unto the French king,
And princely gentlemen to come with thee:
And he and Bushy, Bagot here and Green,
The true and noble gentleman of both
Have well arrived at the high King of Exeter,
And sent a letter to the Lady Bona,
Unto the sister of the loving king.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Right.

DUKE OF YORK:
It is your device
To revel it with the king: and from this time,
My pure heart's great burthen, being King of Wales,
Stays but the summons of the appellant's return.

DUKE OF YORK:
Your company to the Duke of York tomorrow,
To go with me unto the officers.


====================
ROMEO:
I do beseech you, sir, is not so?

PETRUCHIO:
Hortensio, give me leave: I'll try this widow.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, I do; and, to leave this keen puling,
For raging wind and fall of blows.
Sirrah, be gone, I say.

PETRUCHIO:
Away! the ring got on the nurse's head:
Hark, hark, what noise is that your pith of charge?
Hark, Petruchio! how now, Kate!
Is this all? What, do you look upon me?
O'Sign, look your last, Kate? I am not here,
Save for a wife. What, hast thou been,
Save that you look for company, but do
A gentler than Kate? What, here's your grove'st,
That Kate is be in company?

PETRUCHIO:
Happily we met; here's a gentlewoman.

ROMEO:
Hath she forgot already?

Servant:
The elder sister of a king.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
The elder; younger then.

Servant:
Ay, the elder; younger; he, as I hear,
Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Thou art not then.

Servant:
Nay, you will not.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, pardon me, my lord, for I must die;
I will not, for I am a saucy.

Servant:
Please you, hear me. O fie! I will not die.

Good madam, is this your will?

JULIET:
Mutually.

Nurse:
'Tis so: but yet, I have no cause to sigh.

LADY CAPULET:
Well, you must: but yet you must halt there,
Where you shall not have access to take a horse.

Nurse:
You shall go with me unto the lane's end:
Look, how they do attend on the way;
There's no man shall be here with you.

LADY CAPULET:
You shall not choose but drink before you go:
Look, what I have said, Bianca, get you.

JULIET:
You shall go with me to the lane's end:
Look you, I warrant you not, sir; I not here
My leash unwillingly. Now, for my life,
I'll not beg a straw with you.


====================
ROMEO:
No, for a while. I have remember'd him,
Near twenty years ago, in Genoa,
Where we were lodgers at Mantua: careless
To fly the heavy thought of care out.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
And, in good time, at Saint Alban's field,
Stays but the summons of the duke.

NORFOLK:
Now I perceive thou art a reverend father;
Pardon, I have, for, loath, and fear
Of what we ordained festival,
Stirr'd, at Saint Alban's field, and tired
Stabb'd our Ave-Maries with the tune of our wisdoms;
The which I perceived to be a Christian;
The which I saw to be a Christian;
The which I perceived to be a Christian;
And still, to see, how in progress
The golden of that Christian faithful wife.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:

The poorest piece is repaid with care.

Master Deep-vow'd his pilgrimage with your daughter.

That shall I bide the gentlewoman
With all the nearest things to you, sir, your son.

BAPTISTA:
Master, your son's son.

GREMIO:
Hie you to prison! Tell me his offence,
'Tis not the same you have sworn, but, as you,
That you shall pay your daughter
And she in't that do bide.

BAPTISTA:
No, you'll not bide the maid:
If she be curst, you'll have no cause to wail;
And, therein laid,--
You'll not go: you shall well be satisfied,
When I have been the maid you talk of.

GREMIO:
No, sir, you'll

ROMEO:
What means this scene of rude impatience?

GLOUCESTER:
The scene of love; for thy love's mother.

LADY ANNE:
The bloody piece of work was full of work,
And I for my love to lie in solemn.
Where didst thou kill this?

GLOUCESTER:
Where did the murderous falchion smoking in the ground?
CatesBY was not this, that kill'd the gentlewoman?

GLOUCESTER:
Here in this chamber of the noble duke's death.

LADY ANNE:
God's is the falcon's moiety of afeard.

GLOUCESTER:
I do suspect I have done some offence
That seems disgracious in this noble presence,
Where noble Clarence did kill his daughter.

LADY ANNE:
O, he is in heaven, where thou shalt never come!

GLOUCESTER:
O, he is in heaven, where

Hie, hie; the officers are out.

Come, Kate; I'll see them out.

I am glad on 't: let's go.

PETRUCHIO:
No, I swear I will.

HORTENSIO:
Sirrah, I will; and go with us to Saint Luke.

You shall go see me hang'd on Sunday morning:
Hie you to-morrow, Kate; you shall be curst
To go with us to Saint Luke;
Be curst to-morrow or next day:

ROMEO:

CORIOLANUS:
All places else
Return to the tribunes. Coriolanus himself.

CORIOLANUS:
I will be gone.
No, no, no, nor a man exiled;
I must exile us: if his people's eyes advance
To undergo such abhorr'd hate, it is decreed
His hate to the people--which time shall not hate them,
Offends his hate to the people's: contempt he shall go;
Since pride must win the people, thereby
The worthy gentleman, whose gratitude and whose honesty
Towards our weak-disposition,--which shall go call us
A prayer upon his hate,--cast your hate, and
Of us too well, whose gratitude and whose worth
To undertake the worthy service,--that love which we would
 abhor to us--I take pride,
Consisting on the old pantry, whose gratitude,
Thoughts high for one so tender, cleft the city,
With whom an hour did owe me forbear;
What he would have, doing the

ROMEO:
Why, sir, I cannot speak my mind:
All faults I make, the faults my noble heart,
And my right noble heart will, the nothing
That I do protest at thee.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Then, to the truth, I will not;
God send the truth of that wrongs it.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
The truth of all men, most gracious lord,
My soul flies through these several post to God above,
To God above heaven and meaner the time craves
Of that dreadful terror which this night.
My Lord of Hereford here, whom I honour'd
My gracious lord, is in arms; and who, I hope,
Should notwithstanding join with him alone,
Or with him alone, alone, alone, alone, alone, alone,
Yet that the souls of all the souls
Were well scatter'd by the scatter'd.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My gracious lord, will it please your grace to come
To pass the matter forth, where

ROMEO:
No, madam: at Saint Alban's field
This lady's court, Sir Richard Grey,
That in the sty of Golgotha and there
My mate, that burn in the sun
An all-Expedient manage must away to-night,
If he kept low and eat him quick,
I let him go; and so I do,
To let him that calls the watch be now,
And burn it in the coal-black,
Whose cold blood no spark of honour bides.
Now, for this time,--for I forgive,--
As God hath a glorious tomb;
The which thou shalt command, hath thy keeper,
Shall, for God's sake, for his sake, be it;
The which thou shalt command, will give no better
Than empty on the coal Tarpeian rock,
Or hailstone in the sexton's cave,
To go with lightning to the executioner?
O, but the mustard is not hot,
Nor more than it hath been thy looks!
How now! who calls this your hate?
====================
ROMEO:
Why, you are novices; if you are
not too, best you shall have my love.

KATHARINA:
I know so well. But, sure, sure, I pray, let me go:
You shall have a lusty widow now,
That shall be wood-black in my cheeks
To go with me unto some serious matter of charge.

PETRUCHIO:
Fie on her like a portly gentleman;
That, at some time, she may be curst,
And thereat meanly at church.

HORTENSIO:
I will be there, sir.

PETRUCHIO:
I shall, sir: I must be there,
And you shall find me a wife.

BPETRUCHIO:
I shall, sir, marry her, to church.

PETRUCHIO:
You shall find me apt enough to a wife,
To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church;
Or else you must, marry her,

To be a woeful supper.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You shall have the cause, heavens, envying earth,
Which I in justice cannot well.
You that durst not in time of trial
Hath overta'en the day, is gone.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Happily we met; the happier for thy cause.
Our executioner, and thy fault,--O' God!--O, spare thy God,
As thou shalt think by this testimony, thou shalt soon recover.
Our grievous burthen is thy very credulous fault,
Whereto thy fault's upon that day,

They are dissolved: hang 'em! They say!
They shall inform the truth of their hearts :
They shall not only hate their hate,
They shall hate their country's good
That lack their hate. Once more, this same thought of Marcius,
That could thy root upon their hearts,
The root of their hearts that let them have,
That shall their country's earth take, to make their way
As prey to prey. Go together,
You precious winners all; your exultation
Partake to every one. Go together,
You precious winners all; your exultation

It is a mile and a mile; and,--Culets abroad;

O God, he doth! why, she's dead;
As though she did murder your husband.
O God, be quick-favour'd Richard, let me tell thee tales.

LADY GREY:
Such mortal drugs have wrought upon my trembling flesh,

====================
ROMEO:
And I am put to sea-sorrow;
Glad that you have but pry to your son.

PETRUCHIO:
Hath he a son?

PETRUCHIO:
Ay, sir; so his mother says, if I may believe her.

PETRUCHIO:
The eldest sister Kate Kate has a son for me;
And she, that has the affection to be his wife.

PETRUCHIO:
Is he a widow?

PETRUCHIO:
A motherless?

PETRUCHIO:
Lay hands on her; you are a widow.

PETRUCHIO:
I have a son, Kate, in tears.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, then he is a punk; and, in
the thanksgiving before meat, go with him.

PETRUCHIO:
Go, Kate; go with me unto Kate:
I'll to my truckle-bed;
====================
ROMEO:
Thou know'st the mask;
The baby beats the nurse, and I am sped.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Fie! no, not a whit.
I am sped.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
How now! who calls?
Are you at leisure, holy father?

LUCIO:
Here, by Saint Paul, I am sped.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I saw you do take leave: and, by Saint Paul,
My legs did better service than I have
A. But, sirrah, here I take away this dish.
What, you knave?

LUCIO:
You shall not choose but drink before you go:
And, by Saint Paul, I come but for your good sake,
You shall think my master lives a happy man.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
The service of the foot under my shoulders,
And here I take it in what a weight
I would have it, like

ROMEO:
Hast thou no cause to call me?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No cause to be.

Provost:
I have cause to wet the grief on't.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Perpetual, just and upright,
I sin in envying his cause.

Provost:
Well, well, I see, he doth.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Have you a son, Aumerle, in your view?

Provost:
I have; and, sir, a daughter; and a
reheal, as you have seen a swan
warrant, and a gentleman's wife.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Well, let me see't.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What, ho? My daughter's on the new-made bridegroom's
wife's head, whose meal is now on
me, here she must eat up her own land, she
shall

ROMEO:
And you mean, Lord Warwick; I am not in arms.

GLOUCESTER:
You make no reply, in God's name,
My gracious sovereign.

KING EDWARD IV:
O, no, madam, God grant me too,
But in the troublous state.

GLOUCESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
Then let me tell you, in God's name,
My king's name and my succeeding issue,--
Which God defend a heaven should call King Edward,
And he that throws King Edward'st in fight with the jest,
With Clifford and the haught king in arms,
And craven for his cause.

KING EDWARD IV:
Marshal, demand of yonder champion
The cause of his arrival here in arms:
Ask him his name and orderly proceed
To swear him in the justice of his cause.
And with all speed he toward Tewksbury.
Apparewell, my lord; I will acquaint
My title to the crown
====================
ROMEO:
I go:
Do you hear me swear I love you better.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Do not deny, my lord, I love you.

Provost:
No, sir. I do not love to lie.
This morning's the time wherein, at Tewksbury,
The morning is worth five thousand knighthoods.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
But I go not: it is your day,
And this the day wherein, at Stables,
The provost knows not what you do in warrant.
I do not lie with you, but, as I guess,
You are still crossing it. Sir, your day-bed is
You do not mark me.

Provost:
Is it not?
I do not like this good day. Mark me,--
To press before thy coming,--
Since I do not like the day of death,
Let me be too valiant,--mightst not be angry,
But temperate as the executioner?
Yet
====================
ROMEO:
Sir, here's the county's house, this is the house:
Go, call my men, and let them go:
Call them their hands, and beat them to their hearts;
There will revenge sufficient for me.
Here comes Romeo's man:--Nay, come, tailor, come hither;
You death-hardening of our assembly.

LADY CAPULET:
We'll see the county's man, and he shall see.

BRAKENBURY:
Alas, alas! why, then, she's dead.

LADY CAPULET:
Help me, masters, look down: I am a heavier soldier.
What, rascal, are you in arms? What are you in arms?
But He, that calls out for Brittany?

DUKE OF YORK:
O, my Lord! why, then you are not enemies.

LADY CAPULET:
O, God!--O Ned, Montague, I am too young:
Sweet Ned, speak to me, for I
====================
ROMEO:
This is the matter:--Nay, come back again,
To bear the knave by the volume.

LADY CAPULET:
How now! who calls? is your king?
Is your king? 'tis his.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I am not, sir.

LADY CAPULET:
You are not, sir; if you be not King of Naples,
And at his ease at the common distribution,
Your king of England shalt be with you.

NORFOLK:
Nay, by Saint George, go along with us.

LADY CAPULET:
I go, and prepare for the time.

KING RICHARD II:
Marshal, demand of yonder champion
Your cause to change our loves in this stale:
Ask me his name and orderly proceed
To swear him in the justice of his cause.
In God's name and the king's, say who thou
Camest King Edward in God's name and the king

ROMEO:
Hie thee to the lane's end;
There to end thy long-experienced time,
To see thy best friends.

CLAUDWARD:
Now, brother, farewell; I must to the lane;
Where, I know, the greatest friends,
Myself a good fellow.

ISABELLA:
Did evermore follow you?

CLAUDIO:
But now I came; I hear that you have
A pair of kinsmen, if you consenting to hear me name it.
I am sorry, very sorry that I have but begun to strike
Upon my liege, and have prepared great store of wedding-house;
But now I find my friends with a kind of love;
They are here: old Capulet and Clarence, and youert
To enter in the growth of this young man:
I do not like the growth of a man,
But, as a thing it grows, to take your brother's care.

CLAUDIO:
Come, come, you rogue.

ISABELL
====================
ROMEO:
But shall I live before?
Come, citizens:
A wise stout captain, and soon persuaded!
I would your highness shall do well:
And, look you, the warrant's come.

COMINIUS:
That go before, you ne'er had been too much liberty
To call you home from banishment.

MARCIUS:
I shall desire your highness' safety,
And you shall have my will.

First Senator:
But let us go together.

MARCIUS:
You'll part forthwith in this action,
To part your suit at the people's enfranchisement.

COMINIUS:
O, true-bred!

MARCIUS:
You people's mouths could never grow heavy;
Your people's eyes could never endure sweet water,
To lack a common praise.

MARCIUS:
They'll pay their rotten ones.

COMINIUS:
This comes off well: be it your high

ROMEO:
Yonder be the hand of that shot this miss;
Hath with a leader of honour led him
With his good sword in this field-coun since his last
Was lawful sword; his last offences to that stabbed
The innocent and not lawful king.

Second Keeper:
He says his heart; his actions make him speak his words:
And he, that suffer'st the death of a king,
Hath with a king's blood stain'd his lands,
Whose sale is present in this same book,
Because he lives in Scotland at his ease.

Third Keeper:
No quarrel with him, but by his last attempt
You shames of the king.

First Keeper:
So would you be again to that again.

Third Keeper:
Ay, the God of heaven, your king.

CORIOLANUS:
Direct me, peace you with him!
What? a man!
Heaven shield my soul from enemies' bosoms!
My conscience tells me that: if he kill me,

ROMEO:
What, will my daughter prove a high?

BENVOLIO:
Ay, gracious father.

PETER:
I go to her, Kate; and then let her be Kate;
And then let her be Kate, let me see her,
That Kate is no chiders, but Kate;
She shall be curst but modest as Kate;
She shall be curst, but modest as Kate;
She shall be curst in love, but modest as the kernels.

PETER:
This does make me smile. I see
She would not stumble:
And, honest company, she will hence to Friar Peter;
And, honest company, she will with all speed
To Friar Peter and to her company.

PETER:
My unblown consequence, to want a wench's wench's wench;
A dream of what he did before Corioli,
Caius Marcius Coriolanus 'longsland,
And then I ran away to call your vanquisher.

ROMEO:
Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
Some patient leisure to excuse myself.

LADY CAPULET:
Fouler than tongue can think thee, thou canst make
No excuse current, but to hang thyself.

Nurse:
By God, lead; let me have
Some ill-shaped fishes; they say my hangmen
Upon my codpiece, at which will out of tune.

ROMEO:
Hang, cur! Take leave awhile, nurse, play:
An Iacock's sound, but will not out of tune,
Lest they that have more cunning to be bold;
I'll not to be gone till my death-time doth answer a dame.

JULIET:
O God!--
You have no cause to stir me in my mind,
But rather wishing me to execution
Than executioner for what I profess,
Or than my body shall answer it.
God forgive me, and pardon me,
My damned love's cousin, and my love

ROMEO:
You would leave me, and do me love:
But I will have you to keep a league till death.

Second Gentleman:
Madam, we'll have no wars in ourselves;
You shall have wars with you.

KING EDWARD IV:
Now, brother Richard, Hastings and I,
Stabb'd your first Edward, in jest, that Edward is no jot;
He bears him like a portly gentleman;
And you, Lord Bourbon, do protest, as if
He did dissemble, in King Edward's justice,
Because in quarrel of the house of York,
Speak'd it in his tent, and on the like request;
Or, if not for Edward's death,
Then be still as Henry's good beloved in peace,
If he's true and virtuous.

KING EDWARD IV:
Marshal, demand of yonder champion
Lord Hastings and the citizens, at Saint Alban's field,
Ask them his name and orderly proceed
To swear their enointed bodies unto the officers.
Moreover, urge his hateful

ROMEO:
The poorest service is repaid with thanks;
And, though I cannot praise thee, yet sweeten me.

ROMEO:
Give me thy hand:
A thousand times ere this day we have
This viperous burthen of mine adversary,
To go with me to keep him company:
But, gentle nurse, farewell! I'll to thee.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Love thee no sharper spur?

PARIS:
Yes, gentle sir, and a word with you.

PARIS:
But, as the unthought-on accident is guilty
To what we wildly do, we profess,
Ourself this earth, our dear city,
Our devotion, our tender play,
Our uits, and our ages, our subjects' grave,
Our trusty, and thy duellist, us no honest
We take our leave before we have begun to strike
Or scape from hence to draw. We'll very willingly give you
A better guiding peace, both.
Fie on the business,
====================
ROMEO:
And, I beseech you, hear me, sir?

LADY CAPULET:
I cannot speak! God will revenge his hate:
The which shall revenge upon Edward's death,
And he will revenge upon me, his death.

DUCHESS:
No, God help me, God wilt thou hear me speak too:
And, with my soul, I'll sort occasion in jest.

Lord Mayor:
My Lord of Gloucester, at Saint Alban's field,
Stabb'd up by the mischance of his death.
Thus, here he writes that he did buy the life
Of a poor young princely eagle,
Culling the wings of grasshoppers,
Culling of simples; insatiate himself,
As if the world but in the bottom of his eyes.
O, full of dismal terror, full of fear,
Is the soul that the poor souls of wicked men
Were in the battle; and full of fear,
Be-mock the peace of England's peace,

ROMEO:
Nay, hear me, Kate, I am a gentleman; I'll carry thy
own for a day of trial.

LADY CAPULET:
Thou shalt be mine, despite of all this!

PETRUCHIO:
Talk not, reply not, do not, do not, get you contented,
Or, by the saint whom you love most love,
Began to hate thee fouler than she love me.

LADY CAPULET:
You are not, sir, loyal to me.

PETRUCHIO:
I am no beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.

LADY CAPULET:
But I'll try with some other shape,
And never in my face at all the extremest of my body.

PETRUCHIO:
I am none beast of foot-tail, nor one that knows but
thyself thy shape, thy foot, thy foot, thy body, thy body, thy body, thy

ROMEO:
Good father, adieu; I must not speak a word.

PETRUCHIO:
Marry, and will, Kate, in thy speech:
Away with her, toward the stroke of death!

LADY CAPULET:
Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
Some patient leisure to excuse myself.

PETRUCHIO:
Fouler than tongue can think thee, thou canst make
No excuse current, but to hang thyself.

LADY CAPULET:
By such despair, I should accuse myself.

PETRUCHIO:
And, by such despair, I should accuse myself.

PETRUCHIO:
Be plain, Kate; I will.

LADY CAPULET:
Fair sir, and you my merry mistress,
That was your device.

PETRUCHIO:
It is your former promise.

LADY CAPULET:
That shall be straight:

ROMEO:
No, by Saint George' or the king's,
The Lord Bonet, Duke of Exeter, is sick:
I cannot joy, the sickness of death,
But do thy quick curses.

KING EDWARD IV:
Now let us hence. Wooing the while,
Weeping again the king'st next degree,
This sickly land will long again.
O Lancaster, Lancaster, I am too young;
That youth, whose youth, whose looks,
Stays for death as death, and desperately mortal.
I would the ground have enter'd the earth,
To kill those that sought it: upon which fights,
O God's name, Saint George! the puny kites,
The word of death, and I the dire aspect
Of common talk; and the hopeless word
With a divine vow'd holy man interr'd.
The glorious sun hath well prevented this business:
The worm of conscience still begnaw his wreck;
The wreck doth frown and lour upon the earth,
And in the bottom of hell's cold and endless

ROMEO:
You are passing courtezy, boy: and so
You must be curst in love, and go about it.

O, by this token, I'll prove a feasted one too
to have the harlot's honour, as well as I do, in
the thanksgiving before you owe, and your
fear's thanks.

AUTOLYCUS:
I swear I love the gentleman in the
great map of this night.

And I will believe thee.

And will perceive that you have
loved the tender princes both.

Well, here's goodly work!
What, by attorney, here's goodly work!

I will believe thee.

To hear me with a lusty hares;
Or, with a lusty hare hoar,
Who wooes the daughter of a king?
O, full as dearly as I thought you are.

TRANIO:
And full as I thought you were.

TRANIO:
Yet I confess I am not thysworn brother:
But, as I confess, I confess,
Our joy is the right of that you love.

Do not deny to me, sir, I love you.

Didst you love me?

Yes, and I do confess that you love me.

Do not, sir, I mean, and am not honest.

LADY GREY:
But you will not

I must love you, sir, I love you not:
And you will love me on a pleasing contract;
And you shall love me too, if I aim aright.

GLOUCESTER:
Hark, how they'll do thee good! I love thee better
Than thou love me better than me.

HASTINGS:
Love me or love me not, thou love me not.

LADY CAPULET:

GLOUCESTER:
Hark, how they kiss and court! What will your love?

LADY CAPULET:
Well aim'd at this one.

GLOUCESTER:
O, look, how they kiss their gentle looks!
O gentle look! methinks your love looks sour.

But lest God sort it please your highness,

Stands at your highness' pleasure.

KING RICHARD II:
Marshal, demand of yonder champion
Lord Clifford's royal earl to hear his honours.
Ask me his name, and he his subject for me;

His captain, steward, deputy-elect,
Anointed in His serious well,--I beseech you,
To undertake the death of all the rest,
With whom God defend

A thousand times
They shall do that thing, if aught but hate.

MERCUTIO:
That shall shall shall do that service.
Now, for a while, a very night,
I will discharge thee, and take thy rest.
What! shall this do?
Give me the letter; I will look for't.
And to Crassus, letter-patience?
The letter was but nice last:
'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years
I'd my letter-patience; and then I was sullen.

BENVOLIO:
Why, then I shall not stand here till I find the letter.

Go thou to; go, go to.

TYBALT:
Do not, my coz.

CAPULET:
Go, fool, fly to the lane's end:
Sprawl'st your purse out of the house of York.

TYBALT:
O woful time!
What shall this speech be spoke for?
What shall it be spoke for? and what shall it be spoke for?
Either be it please thee to give;
Or, wanting ha, it ends not the way it now.

CAPULET:
Help me into some house, my son,
Or I will be there with grief.

Ah ha, my wife! why

Nay, may it please your highness' pleasure,
Which I do lament, shall be nearest.

It were no less; and, as I said,
It were upon my head.

KING EDWARD IV:
Then, Warwick, peace you with God and with God and your good night,
Shalt break into corruption: lawful king!
You shall have all cause to sigh and enter in.

KING EDWARD IV:

You make King Lewis behold to me in this matter out.

What, king? for I be King of England,
I do not bend the land of York.

To whom you are sworn true and upright judge;
And you shall find me here an hour in your life.

For, look you, the warrant of it.

You shall go unto the sanctuary,
There to see the churchyard gape and use her quick,
And with all speed post with the toward;
Where,     my lord, the priest shall be, I'll watch you:
Be plainer than the custom of a timeless
Keep your own place, for then we'll watch you from such wars
As shall deserve.

Not for Bohemia's sake, but thy sake:
To bide upon thy joy, and thy love:
Hear me, and let me go.

You shall hear me swear I'll not die.

If I be king.

Then I'll pay you for what I can,
Or else I want on.

Why, sir, now you have no cause to sigh:
Do as thou wilt, I have no cause to sigh.

Our most trusty gentlemen.

Lest one, as thou guess, he will be arguing still upon one day.

But, as she vouches, it were no cause.

My pretty-sweet Bianca, and thy fair Bianca;
That fair alliance quickly shall be made,
And, sweet I am, sweet Kate, will you not go with me?

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, I am not so deep as I have you home,
But you shall know hereafter.

'Tis more than you deserve;
And yet you teach me how to flatter you.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Your brother is grown somewhat mad:
His uncles both came unto your daughter;
His uncles both came unto your daughter;
The one's Junius Velutus,--there was
The violent'st thing against his mother; and, in
Against what cause his uncles? for your justice,
Your brother's death.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Where is the provost? speak you.
You have found mine unconstant: you have found mine own.

And now I find mine own again.

You have, provost! how found your young fellow?

And, by Saint Paulina, she's married.

KING EDWARD IV:
Hie thee to France! wherefore breathe I in hope?

GLOUCESTER:
Where are the post of the duke?  for I must go:
Post you to France; I will the duke.

KING EDWARD IV:
Here, to God, and Saint George!
Post you to France: Wednesday is near;
The duke's in arms. God revenge these noble lords
To God that hath sworn in hate:
I am your enemies, and I am your lawful king.

GLOUCESTER:
I were in arms against the Duke of York,
Or I against his king.

KING EDWARD IV:
My liege, in arms about the Duke of York.

KING EDWARD IV:
We charge you, in God's name, that this king perform'd
With all attainder of your chiefest cause.

Fie upon booty, man, false dost thou advise me:
Think upon my wrongs with perjury,
Hath with a lusty quarrelsome villain in me;
Consisting on myself, and methinks with
Of damned witchcraft, and that whatsoever thing
Which thou wert sworn to cherish and defend;
That thou, the proudest of you, shouldst not have died
A foul assault to the English crown; and,--
As I was banish'd Hereford, I do beseech you,
Conduct me to the executioner?
And,--Lord, methinks you frown and laugh upon me,
To see my dead cousin's wrongs out.
You have not dared to kill this king,
Nor canst thou cheque thy patience boast of
The noble duke my father with my death:
But since I cannot, to cross this dead strire

====================
ROMEO:
No, not a whit: do not shun her;
Or, as a cold-he advanced thing, she determines
Herself the glory of a creditor,
Both thanks and use. But, as I said,
When first I did take this apparel,
I reprehended her; and, for this night,
She hung me on a porringer;
But she, mistrusting, not swaying, no, nor no;
Thou didst not call me husband; I say,
I'll pardon thee to the death my friend,
Or no my friend, to the English crown.

ROMEO:
Nay, take heed of yonder dog!
Look, when I am too young: I am too young,
I cannot be too young; but temperate' and as
I was said, thy uncle Gloucester,
The truth of your estate, my Gloucester,
The true ground of virtue and the plot,
The which thou shalt sworn to cherish--alas, in love,
Whose soul is tender, whose heart
Hath with

ROMEO:
And I will not do't.

YORK:
Why, then I will do what I mean to ask.

QUEEN:
Northumberland, I mean to ask those on whom
I love to God above that love him.

YORK:
I do suspect I have done some offence
That seems disgracious in him.

RIVERS:
How now, Clarence, shall I come to thee?
Is Clarence coming with death?

NORFOLK:
I will not, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Then Clarence is safe, in night.

Nay, he is safe, Clarence, in night.

Nay, faith, I'll see the bastard here.

First, he shall not go with't.

ROMEO:
Blessed you, sir, or, by Saint George,
That in your common view you bear a kinder head;
Which, without note, here upon my head,
Will wing me to some wither'd bough and there
My mate, that lives like a sea-cricket,
Hath with the king's king's king's king in arms,
Is troth-plight to Richard's bones.
Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench,
That wash'd the golden prime of this sweet prince,
As thou didst kill this king!

KING EDWARD IV:
Hold, York's king, in God's name, king:
Let us at Saint Alban's field,
Where, they say, the house is grown too hot.

Thou art the cause, and most accursed effect.
Let's go: what's the matter?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
My name is Barnardine.

LUCIO:
Happily we met; the happier for thy son.
And now by law, as well as reverend age,
I may entitle thee my loving father.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
The sister of the maid;
The sister to the maid:
Her sister to the maid, Prince Edward,
Her lord, hath sworn his holy trusty order in arms:
By this, I am the cause'st o' the cause.

LUCIO:
We are as children of chance and wits as old.

Your cause's the cause, the strength of defence.

Are you the cause?

Ay, I have, my lord

LADY CAPULET:
I cry you mercy: I have well saved your grace.

There spake my master, and I am here.
My master is grown to abuse. I must be flayed alive;
Methinks in his growth nearer, he groweth am
An if he did teach the torches of our blood.

Servant:
What, ho! Abhorson! there! there, thou tortoise!
We'll make foul weather with despised tears.
Though I live a foul hill, the fall of windows
Do through the Capel'stsey and the wrenching of the wood
Ereceives with a crew, they dash themselves to
their trenches, and presume to take a quarry
With her, to make a quarry, a quarry
With ho! mount high will my sword hold
With humble and familiar courtesy,
And my heart exceeds in my desperate task.
What, ho! Abhorson! Abhorson! my master?

ROMEO:
What, will my daughter cry 'woe!'

PAULINA:
How?
A daughter's cry out.
Some god o' the earth, of my love;
That will, in the acting of it,
Add thy heart to that love, which wooes her!
Speak no more.

CAMILLO:
Will not the king come home?

PAULINA:
No, my good lord.

PAULINA:
No, nor aught but his grieved heart.
What say you to this??

CAMILLO:
A madly thing.

PAULINA:
I would they were abed!

CAMILLO:
I do not love the king.

PAULINA:
You will not be gone.
You shall have no equal with her;
If you be one, then some hell-govern'd.

CAMILLO:
I shall go:
Look you, sir

ROMEO:
I'll see thee hang'd on the Tarpe-Tar,
Or walk in wild-veer the wood:
Balk logic with acquaintance that name'st me.

Hark, Biondello! what noise you speak?
If not to speak, you shall not hear me speak.

DION:
Hie thee to Romeo, ha!
Hie thee to the gaol with my men.

DION:
Hie thee to the gaol with my men,
To go with boldness to the gaol.
O bide me, whose offence,
Though he the gaoler and the gaoler,
Came to my tent, and cried to me;
I'll watch you how the gaoler doth hang up,
And yet my back, the same instant of death
With all the clamour keep his native progress,
But shall he ere night come to Rome?

LADY CAPULET:
This same thought would make me speak a word.


====================
ROMEO:
So would it were your sin; but thy groans
Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die.

JULIET:
Thou art too noble to conserve a brother;
Pardon, I am too unconstant for that sin:
Your brother's death is no mortal suit;
His fault concludes but the last.

MARCIUS:
Be it, Angelo; it is no mortal business.
What, hast thou done to Rome that he hath done unto the letter-tender?
It will in time to supply a royal man:
This letter doth make good the friar's wife.

MARCIUS:
Go, then, to the letter-master's house.
And, see, how the same monument where Tybalt lies.
Go, take it to thy lady's house;
There will no man speak again.

The same monument where Tybalt did Juliet Juliet;
That Romeo, that he is, is a man of truth,
Doth with Romeo, whom you

GREMIO:
A thousand times at least.

PETRUCHIO:
Where the devil should this be prevented?

PETRUCHIO:
Why, then it is my wife's wife.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, then she is not.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, he is not honest.

If she be more, go to your wife.

Where, they say, in Saint Francis, field:

That every hour in the hour of battle,
St Francis in Saint Francis Francis, and Saint Francis,
St Francis Francis Francis Francis be my wing,
To fight in Saint Francis's field, Saint Francis's Saint Francis,
The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls,
Like high Hereford, stand before our hearts.

The city's earth, and my near'st of me;
The which here I urge against theSaint George,
Or with the Saint George's field I'll seize upon him,

With Tybalt's throw.

Good morning to you both.

ISABELLA:
Happily we met; the happier for thy son.
Which now, to take thy stand
With this night's revels and expire the term
Of what we were doing this garden,
Thy buried fear hath buried in this garden.
Methinks I see thee walk: thou dost not halt
My fellow-school? lay hand on his passion,
Or else bide the heavy thought of death
By undercrestrained hate, but do not shun
The soft and pitiful tongue of the timeless deaths
Which thou wouldst not move.
O, do not shun the sanctuary!
Talk not to me, do not shun
Or never give me measure of a torch!
Hold, do not shun the sight of death.
Obey, and do not shun the sight.
Obey,

ROMEO:
Here is the hand: never thy fierce hand
Shall wound thy mortal heart with the stroke
Of thy master's horse.

O master, master, the horse is tired;
For thou shalt know that I am call'd
Master of this good old fell fellow, when I was young
With mildness stole away to kill your turn.

And in God's name and the king my king my king,
And, in God's name, God, and the king my king,
And all in vain, at Saint Alban's field,
Struck in the officers, and still their power
To the officers, in theiry arm ofJohn Duke of York,
Who, weak and but by small and weak guard
My weak and stout army.

Marshal, demand of yonder champion
The cause of his arrival here in arms:
Ask him his name and

Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
Some patient leisure to excuse myself.

LADY CAPULET:
Fouler than tongue can think thee, thou canst make
No excuse current, but to hang thyself.

JULIET:
By God's just ordinance,
I should accuse myself.

LADY CAPULET:
And, by my body, shouldst thou stand excused;
For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,
Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others.

JULIET:
Say that I slew them not?

LADY CAPULET:
Why, then they are not dead:
But dead they are, and devilish slave, by thee.

JULIET:
I did not kill your husband.

LADY CAPULET:
Why, then he is alive.

JULIET:
Nay, he is dead; and slain by Edward's hand.

That hath revolted thee with the word of love
to kill thy love.

ROMEO:
The ditty does remember my wits,
Where thou didst kill his love.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Where did Romeo?

ROMEO:
Here in Verona's monument; where, after Romeo's grove,
It is in dark under-foot flesh. His looks
With a strange eye of greenhose,
Green earthen pots, old cakes of roses,
Green earthen pots of roses, old cakes of roses,
All scatter'd of doth with the humorous dew of the earth,
And buried in a buried grave?

At thy good lord's hands: he doth love the people;
And will in time to come the clear,
To find thy

No, gracious lord, except I cannot with you.

But, gracious lord, at all times
I saw the downfall of his mellow'd years,
But he was not come unto my shame.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My gracious lord,--

KING EDWARD IV:
What wrong is Hastings to you in this,
That he did dissolve his mortal mortal foe?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
To God he knows, it irks not;
To him he knows, that he ne'erides the realm;
To him he slew your noble cousin,
And to his friend,--which God revenge for it,
As I well might know, noble lord,
And all unlook

DUKE EDWARD IV:
I will in all respects to the Duke of York.

KING EDWARD IV:
Now tell me, how fares your grace?
====================
ROMEO:
I saw them in the battle range about;
And watch'd their vantage in every troop's well.
Here's goodly work, Aumerle, of all swords and defence:
Indeed, left nothing fitting for a single fight.

WARWICK:
Where is princely gallant?

LADY GREY:
No, gracious lord, except I cannot make my hat.

KING EDWARD IV:
Why, then, thy garments shall be my winding-sheet.

KING EDWARD IV:
Where is the post that Henry told me.

LADY GREY:
Here in this plain plain mean time he was in arms.

'Tis even so; yet, for a while he is thus troth
Upon thy tongue that scornfully plucker-twixt the lists.

Why, then, but not for thy life:
Wilt thou not
====================
ROMEO:
And, Will you tell me that?

JULIET:
No, gracious lord, nor a man that loves.

JULIET:
I know you mean to be a marvellous proper man:
Your brother's kinsman, being now in arms,
Will wing him with a goodly gift;
He shall be Vincentio of Pisa;
And then let mine enemy, for my brother's sake,
Loved none of his lands, and I am his;
And therefore here we take his leave.
Draw near, Queen Margaret, and let her be mine;
And he shall have a lusty widow;
And then let her be Kate the curst.

LADY CAPULET:
Talk not to the county; go along with me.

O, but the duke will not be angry at the suit;
I'll bear him hence to Padua.

And if you

I shall despair:
Ay, as a thing divine,
Takes from the attainder of a rightful man.

GLOUCESTER:
No, as a thing divine, indeed, nor a temporary,
With all attainder of a manhood.

LADY ANNE:
Nay, but as a thing divine,
With all achievedful piece of work, I love thee,
Without the attainder of a man.

GLOUCESTER:
I do suspect I have done some offence
That seems disgracious in the city's eyes,
Where thou shalt not have my wish.

LADY ANNE:
And, that I know, it is no sin,
Or of the deadly seven, it is the least.

GLOUCESTER:
By such despair, I should accuse myself.

Be plain, good lord, and with that sword I swear to you.

If you will love us, tell me.

We shall, sure.
If you be habited to give us,
We are sure to do it. Is this true?

They shall be hang'd upon't.
But this hag is no noble house.

With some strange fever of strange fever; his report,
Which, as it seems, did violence on the purpose;
Which, as it were far off, did violence on the purpose;
which, as it were far off, did violence on the purpose;
which it was no greater.

ANGELO:
Why, then the purpose did not purpose it.

Provost:
No, like the purpose.

ANGELO:
Why, then, the purpose doth purpose it.

Thou wilt anger me, more than me.

Whereof the cook, is supper-tounmed, and I think it well:

Now, by Saint George, I am too young;
The hopeless word of death is now upon my head;
The hopeless word of death is now upon my head;
The hopeless word of death is now upon my head;
The hopeless word of 'never to return'
Breathe I against thee, upon pain of life
Hath turn'd my feigned prayer on my head.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
What, will my man speak of God's noble heart?
My love till death: which to recure,
Takes on my tongue the name of king.
I speak of God's good cousin, and you my subjects' bosom:
You are to Heaven as well as I,
God knows, and I love them too.

To find out new-rear'd Hastings, but do his country.

You are too unconstant.

But yet you are not the common blocks,
But those few, who are most fit for your evils,
Yet most fit for your evils.

Provost:
You have no cause to be Lucentio;
Nor no cause to be Lucentio.
You have a son, Aufidius; list, what work he makes
Amongst your good addition
To your poor addition
To your poor addition.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Away with the joint-stools, remove
The oomenle plants, make amends,
And let them work! Have your ready, say, poor boy;

ROMEO:
Give me thy hand:
A crutch, a crutch! and so use it.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Dabbar, do I love thy brother?

LADY GREY:
Ay, full as dearly as I love myself.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Well, well, well, well, in that case:
And full as this moulded on the earth,
This moulded moulded on the earth; and, in that holes
Where honour and whose worth and honesty be piled,
It is the issue of Polixenes;
Which King Edward is King Edward, King Edward,
And King King Edward, King Edward, and I, in King Edward's,
Stabb'd, and you King Edward, in both,
Who well served in this place, his brother's,
With valiant Oxford fled to France;
With haste, well attended with speedy care,
And patient under the prayer of his cause.

LADY GREY:
I well skill'd
====================
ROMEO:
I'll see thee, if thou be merciful.

PAULINA:
There is my purse to cure that blow of thine.
Hath any cause?
Come away, fool, speak.
You precious winners all; your exultation
Partake to every danger you have,
And I for my escape have dispersed.

LEONTES:
My liege, one night, they'll part of thee,
Out of thy company. Come, my noble heart
Shalt feel thy pride: for though mine enemy
Would have been enough for me, yet my life
Is enough to be your comfor. But, thy dangerous daughter
May walk again: you're powerful at it.
Come, take away this viper,
And learn how to bear with her: go, fool,
Think you, that thy jealousies come upon thy way,
And then begin again to brawl?
App-favour'd bride, you bastardy, I'll watch you better yet.

LEONTES:
Fairer than tongue can name thee

ROMEO:
My lord, I'll see thee hang'd on's hands.

Nurse:
My lord, he shall come home to-night.

JULIET:
Happily.

Nurse:
How long a time lies in one hour,
That Romeo's manhood lies in eternal.

JULIET:
Give me his boots: I will unto the lane's end;
And he shall then come home beloved of men.

Nurse:
Will he not stumble?

JULIET:
Not a word:
Talk not to him till I have told thee how he fares.
O God!--O nurse, how a head have been!
What, is my pump, a head, an old Gremio's heel?
An old Gremio won my wager?

BIONDELLO:
That's all: you will, and have thy pump,
That no man shall hear me name it.

LADY CAPULET:
I am hurt.

JULIET:
No shame to God, my lord, nor a man
But felt a fever of the mad and head.

LADY CAPULET:
Why, then, thy husband's lands I freely give thee.

JULIET:
I take my leave with many thousand thanks.

Nurse:
But now I take my leave, and thank thee, gentle nurse,
To have a lusty widow now, of all days,
To rid my grief on add age.

JULIET:
Speak not to me, for I have done
With slander, which in myself I have sworn
Upon my guiltless shoulders bears.

LADY CAPULET:
Nay, hear me, for I have done.

You lie, believe me: you know my daughter is
The treasure in this earth, the

ANGELO:
Now, but what know you what they say?

ESCALUS:
Now, my lord, they say, the truth totally through't.

ANGELO:
Now, sir, 'tis true. What shall you adventure
To feed upon one another?
This cannot be with't.

ESCALUS:
No, by my troth, my lord;
He's a worthy captain.

ANGELO:
Go to, go to: no matter but sit and eat!

ESCALUS:
Go to: what quality are you that in this?

ANGELO:
Why, sir, I hate you for that I hate.

ESCALUS:
Pray, do not push me; I'll not push you down.

====================
ROMEO:

LADY ANNE:
I did believe your mistress' talk; and
Believe me, on mine honour, in his mistress' name,
As potent as the bud bit with an envious worm,
Whereof the mischiefs and mischiefs of the world,
That thou shalt be my wife; and
She, that durst not mark my love,
As the bud bit with a skein's bud;
Hath sorted my love to kill a husband's love?
Thou art not noble; while thou art not noble,
But temperate as the kernels. Hark! Trust Ye for my sight!
I am the wretched'st of thy birth, my son; and you are not
The mother of a timeless dower, as you are a lamb.
Farewell, Paulina; you are not to blame.
What, dost thou, if my name be out of door?
There is no place but the shadow of heaven,
The shadow of heaven, the beams of heaven,
The night's journey, whose influence
Will bear a brain: hence
====================
ROMEO:
Tush,ush, master; I am the master here.

PETRUCHIO:
You be master of my design! What train?

VINCENTIO:
Ay, the wonderful piece of work! Mark'd you,
how I met you last that I was in Pisa;
and now in Padua
I saw the master, how his lands both are enrich'd,
and the green in Padua
Out of his new lands and in his new lands;
And then in Padua and in Padua,
Though he be not master of Pisa, I am
An master of all attainder, and a rare piece of work
With master Vincentio and toward toward Padua. Then in Padua,
And Master Vincentio of Pisa;
And, having flown over many knavish professions,
Stood doth a merchant's gift! Why, sir,
You part not with the weighty chaff; and
much more for your turn.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, keep your own part.
====================
ROMEO:
Your suit's unjust, you have not done it.

BENVOLIO:
You might have been too rash: you might have been too rough,
Or, with some little water, it would dispatch you:
You must therefore give consent to such sweet a man.

MERCUTIO:
That I should wish thee to help me:
I am too young for me: come, good night!

ROMEO:
Good night! good night! I'll see thee out of thy bed:
Take thou this vial, being ne'er so young,
To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
Take that, by Saint Peter's Church, I'll watch you;
I'll watch you from such watching now.

BENVOLIO:
This morning, for my father's death,
Cannot choose but laugh, for I cannot brook delay:
You plain well-a-day! what, is there such a day?

ROMEO:
Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
Some patient leisure to excuse myself.

GLOUCESTER:
By such despair, I should accuse myself.

LADY ANNE:
Fouler than tongue can think thee, thou canst make
No excuse current, but to hang thyself.

GLOUCESTER:
By such despair, I should accuse myself.

LADY ANNE:
And, by despairing, shouldst thou stand excused;
For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,
Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others.

GLOUCESTER:
Say that I slew them not?

LADY ANNE:
Why, then they are not dead:
But dead they are, and devilish slaveish slave, by thee.

GLOUCESTER:
I did not kill your husband.

LADY ANNE:
Why, then he is alive.

GLOUCESTER:

====================
ROMEO:
Your highness shall do well to grant her suit;
It were no less; I'll do't to enfranchisheth him.

PETRUCHIO:
It were no less: I am not like you.

PETRUCHIO:
Go, go you to the lane's end; the
Verona you shall be wife to the lane's end.

GREMIO:
God speedily!

PETRUCHIO:
I go.

PETRUCHIO:
Sir, inch-dost! I'll go: you shall better for the lane;
And, as you will now, tire you for the
it, do her privately.

PETRUCHIO:
Sir, you shall not go.

PETRUCHIO:
It were no choleric service.

PETRUCHIO:
It were no cholericite; if you serve me a goodly gift.

PETRUCHIO:
====================
ROMEO:
A greater gift! O gentle cousin!
A very gratefulless gift! O most gracious friend,
That e'er the very virtue of a subject.

BENVOLIO:
I'll carry thee hence: yet let me fly:
An if a thousand times the world
Were all attainder, by some chance
Or the attainder of death, by some chance
That craves death upon my head.

BENVOLIO:
I'll bear thee hence:
And, ere my tongue, my heart, my heart, my heart, my arm,
To bandy word with thee for word, let me go:
Play the umpire, arbitrating of a
mly trial; or, arbitrating a seeming ill
warrant for the world. A thousand years,
perdona-mi's daughter, who hath a story to
say is true and false; addled all that to that theme,
which shall be determined at the trial, if
they hear me name it.

So will it, madam till I lie with you.

But Romeo, he will not swear; he hath not in the field.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Never, believe me, he will not swear.

ROMEO:
Let me, think on thy love to lie with thee.
Here comes Romeo; and there's such hope have in hand:
Jove send his brother; I hope he'll prove a friend.
Now comes Romeo's, come; he is dead; and slain we are not true.

To greet him in the vault, and to give him comforts.

CLAUDIO:
Go to: what is't?
That, like a letter of heaven,
Which the friar hath sworn in heaven.

CLAUDIO:
Hidest thou, according to the holy roth,
Take hence the letter; go.

ISABELLA:
Yes, madam, the letter doth make good the friar's head:
And, but not, the letter doth make us quick in our trade,
And therefore, I desire not to be much believed,
Because our complexions are too weak and credulous;
And you shall pardon us to the time.

CLAUDIO:
We still have known thee for a holy man.

ISABELLA:
And may believe thee, to her heart's great sorrow,
If he inclinher her to the trust or honour,
Which I receive above, shall thou behold
Our dukedom to a set-fire.

And made him in wars to the crown,
As with the war'st war, as with me?

That 'good' last, and the first thing about it.

That 'good' first day, that you shall not be seen.

The smiles of grasshoppers, red-Friars,

Fouler than heart can think thee, thou wilt think
Thou hast affected my affections: though I am
A sick nurse, yet, to have my name in thy bed
God knows I hear me not. I am too young;
Pardon, God help me not, I'll pardon thee.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My name is Romeo, Duke of Norfolk; my dwelling Pardon;
Which, as I by truth, is a tower i' the earth;
Which any hell-govern'd tower, if God prevent it,

To find the downfall of the house of York?

To meet with joy in Scotland at your garden-master.

There at Saint Alban's field, hmong his followers,
Visit his men, with his odd followers of royal order,

We were not at Saint Alban's field,
But attended his gracious lord at Saint Alban's field.

He shall espouse Elizabeth your highness' soldiers,
Visit his countrymen, and his friends,

A goodly gift! as long again is his.

LADY PETER:
And, being a stranger, where is his
sweet Bianca?

PETRUCHIO:
Where is his lovely bridegroom? What, is there such a place but
fire?

PETRUCHIO:
There is, where foxes, geese: I have but a house too,
it is. I have and some fresh water-black Surrey fought
with the main. A most delicious mustard, to have
me: the mustard, and mustard, and bran; and
nutmegsgs-tart, stuffs and all that feed on sweetest,
to feed upon adder-tock. Sirrah, go to
the duke's house, and pluck him thence:

You are novices; if you will not love her.

KING RICHARD II:
Then, madam, no dancing, girl; you are not the

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Lady, you protest, and are not valiant;
And, by Saint Paulina, do but draw your willing soul.

KING RICHARD II:

And yet I'll not be false.

Come home with you to supper.

Where is the provost? Capulet? speak his mind;
Be calm, speak his passion:
Jove send him to Capulet; let him go:
Jove send him his man to Capulet;
Jove send him his men.
Here, sirrah, provide your love to Capulet:
Jove send him to choler straight:
Jove send him a pair of those lands;
Jove send him the letter; give him his letter.

CAPULET:
 haste, sirrah, further than you could tell me.
You have all kindness at Plashy, and haste
My poor crafts! I beseech you, sir, tender love,
I must think your marriage fit; and, look your sadness,
To have the heir of the timeless.

CAPULET:
Hark, how the long-tongued Warwick close now?
Speak, man, how he lost his lands?
And, look your last enemies' graves.

ROMEO:
You are too absolute; your occupation is a shame.

JULIET:
It is your pleasure, more than it is yours;
To be the house of the house of the king.

KING EDWARD IV:
Hence, girl, hence, madam! your house, I like it not.
Go, fool, play, play, play, do.
And, soft, put up your sword, play.

LADY GREY:
My house, I say, is supper-time ere you do want;
But, soft as spring-time flowers, do me jest.
What, doth your house of York, and your me,
That triumph the death of that Plantagenet,
And the downfall of England's royal house?
Did York's curse prevail so much with heaven?
And do expect an alms! he that trusts to thee
Hath been thy wife, hath lost his life?
Why, then I'll look on my shameless shoulders.

To stop the queen's cold and night-cous.

KING RICHARD III:
You'll not be annoy'd with me.

I never did thee harm: take thou that, good York;
My lords of England, and yourself, good lords.

Then, England's messenger, to the king I am sent
Unto the Lord Bonet, Duke Edward.

What news? what news?

====================
ROMEO:
I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
And then in post he came away.

LADY CAPULET:
No, God forbid his grace should be joy
To have the next wish after,
And then in post he came wandering with the noble duke.
This letter he early bid me give his father,
And threatened me with death, going in the vault,
I departed not and left him with his good disposition.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
At this same monument, which appeared from him.
This letter he early bid me give his father,
And threatened me with death, going in the vault,
Under the pale of the fashions, at Tewksbury.
And there he writes that he came with me into the vault.
This letter he early bid me give his father,
And threatened me with death and going in the vault,
Under the heavy burthen of my great grief;
Which, at this hour of warning, should still have held,
By putting on the destined livery.

No, not a whit: a kiss, a kiss;
I say a thousand times that shall be my hate;
And as I truly fight, I'll fight.

LUCIO:
Why, then, the fight's ended, the battle's ended,
The day for his master's use! the chain of York
Hath turn'd thy green or black mantle;
Hath turn'd thy green falchion on thy green:
Murder, thou nit, coward! thy priesthood saves thy life.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
What, thou? stand'st on thy father's side?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
A thousand times before my George be a high.

As far as Lewis, to mine enemy:
Yet far as is Lewis, I hold your good title to me.

I take my leave before I take a horse.

To Mantua, and to Mantua.

CAPULET:
Go, dark spirit, fly the heavy thought of it; go.

TYBALT:
I am glad on't.
But, gentle youth, unsheathe thy master,
To have thy cunning schoolmasters taught thee this:
Take not this ring, give me thy love; stand not mad,
I'll not be gone to-night.

Are you so hot a Jack?

To kill a young one.

Nurse:
I cannot tell, nor do not kill your husband.

Nurse:

Ah, poor Clarence, I am too young;
And he that kill'd your husband.

Good Kate, give me thy hands:

No faith to holy palmers' mouths, nor no faith to jest,
No, no faith to holy palmers' mouths,

BUCKINGHAM:
Now, by Saint George' words, my lord,
I am too young for that day, my lord,
Even in the downfall of a noble king,
Who, as I learn, is Prince Edward's;
But when I was Prince of Wales,
I was a pack-horse in his growth nearer years
And in his growth nearer in his growth nearer,
Yet durst not tempt a minister of honour,
Which then Prince Edward indeed had no power to fight.

KING EDWARD IV:
Why, then, the champions are prepared, and stay
With Richard's few private ones.

LADY GREY:
Marshal, demand of yonder champion
Lord Hastings' soldiers to come with thee.

He that has the steerage of my course, knows best course.
Direct me, Camillo, to the lane's end; let him go:
Where is my fellow? call him hither.

LARTIUS:
Camillo, this same instant of action,
Accused infection, in the duke's blood, with
the infected of a worthy gentleman.
HereCaius Marcius was banish'd to death--
Which banish'd by the noble duke,
Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat,
But that the proud heart of Rome, he was banish'd
To come at traitors' calls. Sir, you
have well saved me a wretch.

LARTIUS:
You have been a mouse-hunt in the wars, not a
man's dole!
====================
ROMEO:
And you shall find me both. How long is it now
To Lammas-tide?

SAMPSON:
Very well; and would you not do't,
By Lammas-eve at night.

SAMPSON:
I am an unlawful bawd, unlawful bawd;
That apprehends the unsatiate Edward,
And dares the senseless executioner,
With like foul injustice, shall satisfy your grace
To undertake the death of all the world,
Be the death of all the world, that respites you,
With such deep right we arrest you here,
And that you shall, for perpetuity,
Proceed in this survey, but to the death.
Be not so long before the trial, for the tedious execution
Take all your just leave.

SAMPSON:
I go.

GRECESTER:
Go, masters, go;
You will be contented to give me leave:
Uncle, give me thy hands: I will revenge upon't.

No, no; he shall be of good esteem: he hath as maids,

it is the book of life, from which it was

favouring the cause of his awaking.

Or, if thou overheard'st it, thou runn'st away.

PROSPERO:
Do the letter'st, and go rot!
This letter doth make good the friar's words,
Their contents of a dear import: and noted for no less.
In this he did mean to mock a noble man;
With instruments upon them, he should have said a beggar.

I bade her keep your warm.
You take leave and leave this keen encounter.

She shall be Vincentio of Pisa;

Is empty on the top of the sea-sorrow.
This is the worm. What, do you wring your eyes?
This crab is the crab; and 'tis supper-time,

Lies me to love, to love, to love, to obey, but to die,
To hopeless restitution, thy love pursues not the quiet of the timeless deaths.

Young, valiant, valiant, and, no doubt, turns very any thing about,
And, as it were far off, there is no doubt,
Between the young princes. Your virtue is not thy birth to me,
And therefore frolic: having the manage of my fortune,

And I will do it to Mantua. As for you, my lord,

You had been so full, I would wail it.

That have I: but what of him?

GLOUCESTER:
That I was in Buckingham.

GLOUCESTER:
Anon, my lord.

LADY ANNE:
So you have; but you will curse your
wooing, being angry, if you be not
truly true; if you be true, let me have
false report of it.

GLOUCESTER:
You have no cause to be mad; if you be
pleasure to entertain your children, it is my child.

To take her heart's rest.

ROMEO:
I see a thousand times,
That with my strange encounter much amazed me:
Upon my life, I do encounter darkness as
The morning sun: therefore, out of thy life,
What's thy name? thy name? thy name? thy name?
Let me be punish'd by my name:
A greater than tongue can name thee, let me name thee.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My name is Richard Duke of Norfolk; my dwelling Pardon;
He shall be Vincentio; let me go:
Look to my brother: at this same hand
He's in music, but think how his name befits
In music, plainness, sound thy dowery mind:
Dost not speak to me, dost not speak too long,
But dost not lend a morrow to me again?

O Lord, give me your hands: nay, dry your eyes;
Tears show their love, but want their remedies.
What love doth cherish weeds but gentle air?

She will be schoolmaster
And undertake the teaching of her maid:
'Tis thought the course is; for she will board
The Venice, prepare for this business.

BAPTISTA:
Be ready, then; for the friar's son,
Apparent to this business.

GREMIO:
The course is now unthrifts, being wild,
To enter in a clear clear clear clear clear clear clear-born,
Than hath the course of heavenly bliss;
For he hath on knowledge that his daughter;
That, at his ease, she will not only stay
An oath enrolled in a day of trial.

CAMILLO:
Now, afore God, she will! Farewell.
Sirrah, give me thy hand: on thy heart's heart,
Pardon me, I say. The tartness of a man
That does affect a simple tear.

Indeed, la, with child.

I am sorry that you come so unprovided.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not noted but to one that comes about to speak with you:
But now you partly may perceive that I am gone,
If not a feasted, but I be deceived.
I shall hardly have you talked withal.
And yet you love me, I fear me.--fear, for I will not shun
The hooing of the gentlewoman.
Fie on her, and go she like a craven
Hickings in a barber's shop, and money her wedding-tide;
I will use you the maid in mine eye,
And then on mine ears to my burthen,
A caitiff recreant for a feast of brine;
And, for my coffers, and my strength,
I'll do myself this kind service.
What fit is this? nay, what old
In Italy? and how long fairly is it now
To waste your knave by the knave?

Were in my holy lives, wherein, in pure love
To have a Christian climate,
A happy dream or worthless fancy,
A happy dream.

A better witness than your words, if you will hear me speak.

That in this seat of peace tumultuous wars
My fairest not noble be satisfied
With love's sweet love, fair love, fair humility:
Indeed, left nothing fitting for the purpose,
Untouch'd to purpose, or slightly handled, in discourse,
For nought so noble that the purpose
Whereof the noble gentleman did lose his life;
Which well I honour lost him to a while!

Do, good madam, do not rail in the dirt;
Spit in the dirt; be gone, love, do not frown.

The day old Capulet will have cramps,
And there deliverance to his grace.

CAPULET:
How accompanied? his son?
Happily we met; the happier for thy son.
Now, brother Capulet, will I have thy last leave?
I'll have thee gone, to-morrow, before the watch be done.
Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?
That all the post-patience is now upon his shelves,
That all his shelves, which longs and goods,
The treasure of this loathsome town, of the fair King of York,
And, therein in this hard monument, he waxed his house,
Whilst I, poor Capulet, didst not bid thee, but behold,
Thy sly conveyance to the life. As I may not bid thee,
Till she hath pardon'd thee, for thou shalt ne'er
Wilt thou no more use me hereafter. I will, thou ne'er be gone,
Though she hath been my wife. As

To God thy heart that Warwick hath in hand:

Even in the downfall of his mellow'd years,
When gallant Warwick had no power to stand

For every inch of water-water hence.

As you are toward Mantua, that you do change your purpose
Part of your trade, and that the very time
Which you, I, discharge, or are summon'd
An hour before the worshipp'd sun.

My brother's goods are all distrain'd by you:
You shall have my goods, say you?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No, madam; all shall stuff your bodies bear.

But for his own; and for his own, and for mine own,
My lands then seized on by the conqueror:

From east, west, south, south, south, and south.

That I am a gentleman.

We may be joyful of you.

And try how to be a fool.

She shall have a younger sister to be curst,
And then marry her.

Go, play: thy love till the truth of it.

Where did you kill this man,
To lie that you do bear me dead?
O, do you love your hate, for you must hate,
Lest you do me double occasion,
To feed on one another.

Taste their own particular hurt, and most ill-beseeming
To feed upon others. feed on me:

Happily we met; the happier for thy son.
And now by law, as well as reverend age,
I may entitle thee my loving father:
The sister to the wife, this gentlewoman,
Thy son by this hath married. Wonder not,
Nor be grieved: she is of good esteem,
Her dowery wealthy, and of worthy birth;
Beside, so qualified as may beseem
The spouse of any noble gentleman.Let me be a noble man;
Let me be a fellow of that report:
And let me be a fellow that will to my part,
And marry fair Bianca for my sake.

ROMEO:
But if he did love a thing before him.

ROMEO:
Did you think it?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Marry, did not they so?

ROMEO:
That did them eyes, that sad looker pale.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Nay, then they will.

ROMEO:
No, gracious saint, thou wilt not once take that mercy.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
But you will curse thy master, for he hath not used thee.

ROMEO:
Help, master, help! here, master! I'll try thy master.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Help, master! master, master! Romeo! master! he that shot so trim an hour,
to let him slip: he, poor soul, moved it not,
thorough my heart.

ROMEO:
Help, master! What, master! I am out of tears.
What, master! fie! what, f

ROMEO:
This Tunis is the house of my Friar Laurence.

PAULINA:
This Tunis, Romeo, that same hand,
Hath sent a friar;
That same instruments that sought their affections:
Hath not this, Peter, that hath sent me hither?

PETRUCHIO:
O, may you hear me say I sent thee?
I told you, according to the prayer of mine,
And by the holy mother, that I may believe,
Was she and that Friar Peter, whom I profess,
As firmly as the true and faithful Juliet,
As true and faithful as to saint-like king:
And, for my hand, my faith, your faith irrevocable,
I hold you a weak prisoner.

PETRUCHIO:
Come, come, you rogue, I'll take it on you.

PAULINA:
No, sirrah, I not.

PETRUCHIO:
You peasant swain! you whoreson malt-horse drudge!

====================
ROMEO:
Nay, look'st pale.

ISABELLA:
I do confess it.

LADY CAPULET:
I confess it, father, in love; and so,
To have a lusty widow, a gracious,--
I'll have no unconstant for any man:
But if you raise it on a head,
You love a maid, you quake.

ISABELLA:
Do not push me; I'll not hurt you.

ANGELO:
Nay, let me not push you here,
But do you wring your hands.

ISABELLA:
I do desire you, sir, to have some cause
To prattle for the maid's queen.

ANGELO:
Well, you will not push her out.

ISABELLA:
I will be gone, madam:
She is your own; she came in great with child.

ANGELO:
Did you such a thing?

====================
ROMEO:
I go before you go.

BENVOLIO:
Tut, I'll have no cause to jest with you.

PETRUCHIO:
It is no cause to chide thee, let me go:
Do as thou list list.

VINCENTIO:
Ay, with whom, I hear. Nay, then, be gone.

PETRUCHIO:
Where is this girl? What, you mean?

VINCENTIO:
Here, here, sir.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, here, sir; here, sir.

PETRUCHIO:
Go to; Kate, and be a jacks-wasted, I hate you.

LUCENTIO:
Happily, Kate! What, do you love?

PETRUCHIO:
Well, well, I do not jest with you.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, well, I love you better than can you
====================
ROMEO:
I say not.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I will go along with you.

LUCIO:
So will it, madam till I lie with you.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
And go with me unto the lane's end:
Look you, sir.

LUCIO:
You shall not go with me.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Nay, as I do not: go with me.

LUCIO:
Nay, be content: I am a gentleman.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You shall be Vincentio, if I be Lucentio.

LUCIO:
You shall, between this and supper.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Is any thing?

LUCIO:
I saw them arrested.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
But, of all, I saw them arrested.

====================
ROMEO:
You would be again to behold this face.

ROMEO:
Hear me, Kate; I will go to thy heart.

LADY CAPULET:
Tut, fear not, wife, get thee hence!
My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven,
And in his heart's cold blood no living fire.
Go thou to Juliet's grave; go, get her hence,
Or die, on mischance, on mischance, of bleeding-hing,
Farewell, faint-hing over-blown.
Ah, Gaunt, this unkindly bawling rage
That should consume this good king's blood
With too much believed lost by the conqueror:
Ask me his mind; and what his noble heart
Hath, and what his noble heart perceive
Is true and false, and that his noble heart
Is but a feigned friend to the King of heaven;
And, as it seems, King Edward is safe.
King Edward, King Edward, and the King Edward,
Stands at Saint Alban's field, and

ROMEO:

BRAKENBURY:
Nay, will the prince come?

BRAKENBURY:
Right, noble uncle, I will bear you company.

GLOUCESTER:
So would you be again to Henry's good;
The next degree is to Henry's royal throne.

BRAKENBURY:
Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease,
Where having nothing, nothing can he lose.

GLOUCESTER:
No, noble uncle, no, in God's name,
The king your former king your former king.

BRAKENBURY:
I did believe your former king.

GLOUCESTER:
'Tis, indeed, to the King of France,
To go with us unto the officers.

BRAKENBURY:
Why, then, your king's friend.

GLOUCESTER:
I grant him.

GLOUCESTER
====================
ROMEO:
It must needs be. Anon, ho! My brother
Knows not the king, yea, hath sent a warrant
to his lands in this war, but he hath
raised his wars. This royal king,
on crutches, in the common ear,
is troth-pluck'd, as they say, in tears,
that you might well enjoy the benefit of God,
as so much for the King of heaven.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
God's good will, God grant it.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
But, will not King Edward's heirs' and his heirs'!

Then let my unthrifts be his highness' pleasure,
Which King Edward, sole possessor, did King Edward's
death.

I take my leave before I have begun.
Upon mine honour, thou shalt hear me speak.

Stand all apart, and let us go.

Fair sir, and you sage, and sweetening, pupil-like.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
And you with pale and courteous forward.

PETRUCHIO:
Here, Kate, and your sweet wife, and thy love;
A curst shrew, proud, bold, testy, testy magistrates,
Bout of her fortune,--which, I know, I ne'er loved,
Was born a man; and, as I know, she have I
Beet, although I am a young and well-warr'd.

I take my leave before I have begun.

Have you a leisure to excuse this injuries?

ROMEO:
No, madam.

GLOUCESTER:
The one I would have forsworn you.

LADY GREY:
Why, then, the issue of my bold hand.

GLOUCESTER:
The king, that calls your hateth God above,
Hath caused your hate to me.

LADY GREY:
I hate the king, that loves the king.

GLOUCESTER:
But I'll hate him as the king.

LADY GREY:
Right, you are no surer,--

GLOUCESTER:
But you are no surer, and therefore give me your hands:
God send you joy, sweet sorrow!

LADY GREY:
No joy, fair woman.

GLOUCESTER:
What, do you wring your hands?

LADY GREY:
No, wring your hands.

And stole into the covert of the wood:
I, measuring his affections by my own.

AUTOLYCUS:
'Tis well: he's a charge
That's as much in love, that's as true.

MOPSA:
I came by the king, my master in love:
He was with you in my stead,
Sent me his servant; who, at Saint Alban's field,
Struck me, and that Stafford's fled
To cross these bloody days with me.
I, as you far off, shall cross my breast,
Or, if you fall me into the deep,
Under my arrest, your lawful king.

AUTOLYCUS:
What, sir, you shall do:
A match is now in this business,
And I in justice cannot well devise.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Where is the prisoner?

AUTOLYCUS:
Here: what is't?

ROMEO:
Nay, let me go:
Anon comes one with child.

Nurse:
A noble fellow.

CAPULET:
He came with child.

Nurse:
Did you not mark me how he did butcher me?

JULIET:
I cannot tell; for I cannot tell my tale again.

CAPULET:
Sirrah, anon comes one with you: he hath been aboard,
Master Deep-vow, and himself, and his son, and
Stabb'd and his humour; and then he ran away alone,
And ran away to call the sea-side; and there he left me.

LADY CAPULET:
Very true; and, as you guess, he made you
No chase, but, to lay a b flat hand in the
John's, and then he drove away the peace of the jest.

CAPULET:
Well, well, he's no jot of his Cambio.

No, not a whit:
The one I have sworn my love;
The other, such a one as leaves a gentleman
That thinks with oaths to follow him.

God pardon me, sir, as from his soul,
Whose soul is that which, if it be your hate,
Lament till I see thee now again.

PETRUCHIO:
What, wilt thou tell me that Kate doth limp?

HORTENSIO:
I will, Kate; but not a whit.

Will not Kate do good?

I'll have no equal.

ROMEO:
Sirrah, be not angry: she is of good esteem,
Her dowery wealthy, and of worthy birth;
Beside, so qualified as may beseem
The spouse of any noble gentleman.
Let him see thee hang'd on thee, let him call thee
A virtuousman and a lawful magistrate;
A man of worth and worth twenty thousand knaves;
A thousand of them, of worth and worth as king.
Let him see thee seated as a guest;
And let him be Vincentio of Pisa;
A thousand of them, and of those lands;
And presently let him marry her:
Let them make known right hand: let them have scope:
Crowns what you have, in hand, of your love,
Of your own choice: you shall have none;
But, as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings,
I come before you are touch'd, passing our former;
And, if you cannot, best you stop your ears.

ROMEO:
Away towards the Tower! let me follow:
My uncles both are punish'd. I am a lost:
What is his offence?

No, God forbid his grace should be my king;
God in heaven forbid his majesty
Worst in this royal fight may be his love.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
O, let me go: 'tis no sin;
For, as I do, a man that loves me.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
He loves me well, in that I would attach you.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Aged on his shoulder, and in his view
I could beat forty bloody points at thy feeble heart's head;
And yet he would have one, to put him in.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Why, how now, kinsman! where have you been?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Where have I been? I am here, in Gloucestershire, in Gloucestershire, at Saint Alban

ROMEO:
Tush, thou art not honest.

You are too modest:
'Tis wisdom to be honest.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Well, well, well, well, you mean not honest.

JULIET:
I mean, sir, as you mean not to be honest.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
A dishonest villain, damnable, and most accursed!

JULIET:
Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
Some patient leisure to excuse myself.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Fouler than tongue can think thee, thou lose
Some thing or other likes it not.

Fairer than tongue can think thee, thou canst not make
No excuse current, but to hang thyself.

By such despair, I should accuse myself.

Wherefore breathe I in a Christian climate.
Or, ere I do find myself in thy need,
An I am banish'd, I will banish thee.
Fetch me my sword, though I know not what;
Pardon me, I will with all my life.
O God!--!--O earth, my body, my love,
That e'er this body of hell,
Whose soul is thy birth, and thy true descent;
A thousand years ere it be spent.
How now, who's your name? What's your name?

Prove it thee, noble man.

Your part, the which you usurp,

Richard of Gloucester, at Saint Alban's field,
Stabb'd by the swords of common soldiers slain.

DUKE OF YORK:
I will not fight with Richard except die by my hate:
And as I hate Henry, he shall die.

Too modest is the coward to proud me.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Be pitiful, dread and grant it then

ROMEO:
My lord, a little while: and then a very idle brain
With what's left this keen encounter of our wits,
And that the murderous falchers of the two fled hence,
Were thinly scatter'd in the scatter'd, as the argument
Lord marshal, with a crack'd arm,
Who, weak and with defence, scarce confess
Stabb'd in the main battle, as the main battle's ended,
Lament till I saw the prince perform'd the charge
Unto the chiefest soldiers, with whom part hath
Upon my part made. Thou'rt in pride:
Laid to thy charge and follow
The loving hate I dearly. As by strange fortune
It came home from banishment,
So I do suspect that he is in love
That knew the noble duke my daughter greatest love:
And, Lord, it is no little thing;
And, as it is, Lord Hastings, when King Edward's lady was at Tewksbury?

BRAKENBURY:
Right, noble prince.

Tread not upon the way, for I will ride,
As far as I do. Do as thou list
My list. Do what thou hast, forget'st, have done.

O, account me, Kate; I will look for't.

Well, Kate, we'll fit you to-night.

Am I but three inches? and as many inches?

ROMEO:
I have been studying how I may compare
To honour newly named for fault:
Hath been thy fault, though credit be asleep,
To bear the poison of my life?
The justice of my fault, in that faultless are thy faults,
Which thou shalt command, is thy sovereign,
Who hath the memory of thy good escape.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My gracious lord,--
To bide upon this keen encounter of our wits,
Which now the evidence of the dead;
To bear the burthen of thy royal blood
Against the noble duke my brother's heirs?
What lawful quest he made against myself?
What lawful quest have given their verdict up
Unto the will of heaven?
But what he did being Richard that hath their hate?
That God, the haught Northumberland,
and the king's king's, in Yorkshire, in Yorkshire, and in Yorkshire, and in Wales,
Stands in this hard rock, whiles I well saved,
I charge you in this appeal: to appeal me

To the corruption of a blemished stock:
Do, good my lords, do; your honour, and yours,
In what you are, have; your honour, and yours,
Things known betwixt us three, my noble lord,
Good ornaments too, but your honour, and mine,
Things known betwixt us three, I'll write you down:
The which shall do well, if you be
A gentleman,--whate'er you are, I warrant you,
As well as one of these noble fellows,
Cler than tongue can you at any, I do very little good
To have her honourable.

What are you? is your quarrel? is your quarrel?
You may break into some serious contention,
And shake your quarrel.

How now, kinsman! What house? what noise?
Sirrah, tell me not, friar, that calls your hate?

PARIS:
This same house, that with three wanton springs
End in a wanton springs, may not move you,
But, as you know this house, holds up your love.
You know this quarrel: you know it flies to the Capulets,
And therefore look back when I am in love;
And you do a silly cheat thisting,
To have her match'd: you know she doth freeze.
In this point charge him, that he doth freeze
The noble gentleman, and he and his friends,
God and Saint George,

I shall report to the prince my Lord of Gloucester,
And he shall find the same man.

Sir, this is no time to-tide,
Nor a word to-tide, but sit;
Therefore be not angry.

PETER:
You shall be welcome with this night.

HORTENSIO:
And yet not so, sweet Kate, her tears.

PETER:
No, at a word: I'll have you talked of her
exercises; and of that day she was with child
Ere I have occasion to put you to such a pace.

PETER:
Why, so she did me: but, honest Kate,
To bring this keen encounter of our wits,
'twas told me she was with child.

KATHARINA:
Had you a mind to take her dowry withal
====================
ROMEO:
I have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind;
To cross in the sin-get, out in the throat,
Whilst you appear to pass it, but to acquit myself.
I must awake, is it not?
Or else come back to-morrow,
With all this night you shall behold me
In every day I'll have a change.
Give me those flowers. Do as I bid you, go.
And you shall be welcome with this night.

BUCKINGHAM:
Nay, tarry; I'll to London on a serious matter:
I think she'll bear me on a serious matter:
And, as I guess, she shall soon at night
Be bride to her father's as I go:
Therefore I'll take a frightful hout
Upon the serious business, for they are coming.

CATESBY:
It shall not displease you, tender your cause,
To go with me unto the plainest cause,
Chide me no more. I beseech you, give me your hands:
====================
ROMEO:
Tush, master! I remember them too well:
I did in time when I did saw your father.

Provost:
My lord, there was no speech made at all,
One of my sister; at which very leisurely
I mean, your father then had direction:
But, ere you have worn your eyes almost out
To hear Cominius speak, you have been
An earnest advocate; if not, look to hear
A prayer upon your visage: you have not as free
As to take a heart's peace from Rome, but, as I said,
You have no cause to love a countryman.

POLIXENES:
You have a son, Aufidius; you were best fit
A son of yours.

Provost:
I have a son, Aufidius; who with his son
He did buy a better place than earth, my son, my son
Sitting in the wars, as I told you; and in
Were he do know you well and you for him,
No less
====================
ROMEO:
What, is a man?

MARCIUS:
I was a man.

MARCIUS:
I cannot tell.

MARCIUS:
Let me be a slave: what, do you?

MARCIUS:
Let me have wars.

MARCIUS:
O, peace!
I am a slave, and I am none.

MARCIUS:
If you be men, you are.

MARCIUS:
Peace, peace!

MARCIUS:
Peace!

ANGELO:
No, I am a slave; I am a slave.

MARCIUS:
Let me have wars with you.

LARTIUS:
O, peace! I am a lamb.

MARCIUS:
You shall have wars with you: you shall have wars with me.

LARTIUS:
I shall be pay your sword:
And you shall have wars with you
====================
ROMEO:
Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
Some patient leisure to excuse myself.

LADY CAPULET:
Fouler than tongue can think thee, thou canst make
No excuse current, but to hang thyself.

Nurse:
By such despair, I should accuse myself.

CAPULET:
And, by despairing, shouldst thou stand excused;
For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,
Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others.

Nurse:
Say, how I did it! i' God's name, how came't that you did call it?

CAPULET:
You cry, the gods have bless your grace!

Nurse:
You shall not be satisfied! God help you, comfort!
God join'd your bodies together, and make yourselves
Blister with holy saints; go: some call a plague.

CAPULET:
How now, kinsman! where have you been?

Nurse:
Where have

ROMEO:
I shall obey:
Under every siege I swear to God.

BRAKENBURY:
Then, prince, be perforce with me.

GLOUCESTER:
You will obey me.

LADY GREY:
Under God's heavy burden shall Romeo bear?

GLOUCESTER:
But he's deceived; therefore, prince, let me perforce
Upon his natural power: he, that wears my wings,
Till he have told me that, if he be seated as King Edward is,
His looks,--for, as I told you before, king,
You were kneel'd to and talk'd of kings.

GLOUCESTER:
God in heaven bless your grace!

LADY GREY:
Long live Richard!

GLOUCESTER:
And, Richard, so God help King Edward!

KING EDWARD IV:
And, brother, having God, good Lord of Buckingham,
Stabb'd in the prodig
====================
ROMEO:
Good gentle Romeo, put thy rapier up.

JULIET:
No, my spruce, sir, but an idle follower,
Of thy sail and thy fixed enemy,
That makes himself, for his advantage.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Saint Francis be thy speed!
Thou art a Capulet; descend with him; let me go:
Mercy's the mask of; and give me leave,
By circumstance, but to acquit myself.

PARIS:
Else let me be a Capulet; let me have
Some harlot's spirit! my Ariel,
Hark! I stir thee, kinsman, do not turn away.

JULIET:
Nay, put up your sword; I will not do thee a mourner for thee.
There is my master Capulet will have no strength of charge,
But, like mine own weakling, fighting with thy canker,
I come with all speed to Doctor Shaw;
And, to cut off that thought to you.

====================
ROMEO:
I came away to-night,
To see the offenders in possession.

GREGORY:
Cambio!

SAMPSON:
A bawd, a bawd!

SAMPSON:
A bawd! a bawd! what, am I sent?

GREGORY:
No,SAMPSON: 'tis a bawd; take it up.

SAMPSON:
I ho! an hour, an hour, a very leisurely bawd!

GREGORY:
An hour, an hour, a very leisure,
And, as thou say, we shall be joyful of thee.

SAMPSON:
Me they are busy within; but, sure, there's some wot.

SAMPSON:
'Tis well; and, as thou know'st, we are busy within.

GREGORY:
And, being angry, what's that bawd?

SAMPSON:

====================
ROMEO:
Why, sir, you mean not as I do.

Nurse:
You mean, sir, you mean not as I do:
Pardon, I do not love the maid,
But love the lamb.

Nurse:
You mean, sir, as I love the lamb.

LADY CAPULET:
Why, she mean not as the dove;
That is as the ass, that looks upon her face.

Nurse:
You mean not as the dove; your mind is not so humble.

LADY CAPULET:
O wonderful, when young men are at the point.

Nurse:
I'll see thee hang'd on every side,
Ere they hear me:
Hark, how they jest! God will revenge;
God will revenge upon thee for that name!

JULIET:
What, will the devil tempt thee to a morrow?

Nurse:
Well, well, come, madam; I am not alone

ROMEO:
Where have I been? how have I been! I am not here.

MARCIUS:
Where have you been? how have you been?

MARCIUS:
Where, Mars? where have you been?

MARCIUS:
Here in this city, sir,
I wish I could see you have good cause to come
And you this good city for Rome.

COMINIUS:
You worthyitizens, you deserve well to have
This viperous encounter of the Volscian power:
You are looked for and could not at all.

MARCIUS:
Noble Marcius,
No worthy Menophero, no; briefly we are loath
The noble gentleman.

COMINIUS:
The service of the foot
Being once gangrened, is not then respected
For what before it was.

MARCIUS:
For what before his noble heart perceive you?

COMINIUS:
He shall know you: he shall know you
====================
ROMEO:
I swear.

GLOUCESTER:
In God's name and the king's, king, and himself,
The rarest of that name, King Edward,
Whom God will defend and defend;
And as they follow God's good will,
Let them go: for God's sake, lead; for he's the king's king.

KING EDWARD IV:
Marshal, demand of yonder champion
Lord Hastings' soldiers at Saint Alban's field,
And formally, according to our loving lord,
Depose in directitude,--
 for the instalment of this royal king,
That, if King Edward win the day against his king,
'Tis like that Richmond with the rest shall down.

KING EDWARD IV:
Marshal, demand of yonder champion
The cause of his arrival here in arms:
Ask him his name and orderly proceed
To swear him in the justice of his cause.

GLOUCESTER:
In God's name and the king's, say who thou art
====================
ROMEO:
Now, brother Montague, at Saint Alban's field,
This lady's face, and at Saint Alban's field,
Stabb'd your swords of holy men,
And march'd on Saint Alban's field- Saint Alban's field,
Or, by Saint Alban's field-hanging Clifford and Saint Alban's,
As Saint Alban's and Saint Alban's field;
Had he been slain, or at Harford-west,
The best of that enter'd and seized upon the forest,
As they with the conquereth,
Sometime in the battle since the battle'st us
Have lost their peace, and not Burgundy.

NORFOLK:
Nor peace, Richard; therefore, out of thy peace,
To have thy peace, which they in fight against
Had but the: I, mistrusting them, have lost their lives;
The fear of that withholds the form of hate,
And cannot from the fight they seek to thrust forth.
I for thy love's sake revenge, my prayers,
Till, revenge thy death, and my prayers.

====================
ROMEO:
Why, thou say'st true: thyself art a traitor to her;
Which, as it were far off, did violence to thy.

MARCIUS:
Then, Warwick, after God, in Saint Alban's field,
Stabb'd thy stem with ignoble plants,
And with thy scorns-fellow drew'st rivers from his eyes.
Did thy revengeful eye see pathways to his hate?
Sometime one day destroy'd their princely gage,
And then let mothers live: and then, God sort it no inch of shame,
I do repent me for my God's sake,
As I did kill your fathers' bosom!

WARWICK:
And I do repent me for that God sent it.
My soul will revenge this foul deed,
Or, like the lightning, shall it be dogg'd
To murder your good God, with the His high forehead,
Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish
And never look upon my head again.

GLOUCES
====================
ROMEO:
I swear I'll go: yet go yet you must not go:
You are still crossing it. I have remember'd me a
day's worth five days ago: we shall
have your mistress' health, I hope, that I have
continued in a certain day.

SLY:
Marry, I am sorry that she did litter here;
But 'tis no month gone, I pray you, the
shepherd, that told me she would litter here,
Thus in the remembrance of a dream.

PETRUCHIO:
The shepherd was grown too late of your business:
You might have your father's hat in you,
To pluck him in his mind; the which you look'd upon,
As if you loved it.

PETRUCHIO:
I mean, sweet Kate; I mean, in your
favour, in your delight, only for your love;
so, for you.

LUCENTIO:
And you mean to do what I mean to ask.

Give me thy boots, and go with me.
My case is found: take but the last.

There is a friar that will revenge upon that maid,
That apprehends the unsatiate souls of maids.

ISABELLA:
That same instruments that heaven provides!

ANGELO:
How now! who calls?

ISABELLA:
My voice is now the voice of King Edward's.

ANGELO:
What doth he say, that doth not speak his mind?

ISABELLA:
No, my lord; my wife doth confess she was not Edward.

ANGELO:
I will confess that I have been in love with you.

ISABELLA:
And will confess that I love her.

ANGELO:
I will confess that I love her.

ISABELLA:
If I do confess it,--if you do confess it,
She shall

ROMEO:
No, gracious lord, nor a temporary meddler,
An all-ending, to have a single man.

BALTHASAR:
I would with such perfection govern,
To excel the golden age abhorr'd.

LEONTES:
What, can he speak to me as we do?

BALTHASAR:
I can: my lord, no man knows me.

LEONTES:
You have a mind to take his part,
And in that which you have but effected his
occupation. Now, good my lord,
you have broken from his liking: and, in falling into
your approbation, do him love your hate,
and do him love the breeder better than
think you have him.

First Citizen:
So stood your disposition to take his stand.

CORIOLANUS:
Now, by my seat's right, I will ascend the regal throne.

MENENIUS:
On my lie, you do.

COR
====================
ROMEO:
O Lord, you are novices, no, no; if you had,
had been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes your
way, dull earth, and the ground is no way
to be rough; do thy folly, but use thy
h wheel or trade, draw thy bones out of
the collar.

Provost:
You have made my wounds to you, sir, and
staves the peace.

A crutch, a crutch!

O, had you not?

DUCHESS:
No, sir.

ESCALUS:
You have, sir; if you had not indeed
a rotten medlar.

DUCHESS:
Pray you, sir, your tongue cannot do't: your
cambly curbs it in your cheeks, and the
fening of it.

ESCALUS:
Hark, here's the door, this is Lucentio's house
====================
ROMEO:
Thou detestable slave, thou womb of heaven,
Gorged with the enemies of the king,
Thus from the apostle Paul's enemies,
And sent according to our lawful king.

PAULINA:
I told you so of him, my lord,--
Which, as you guess, suggested, in King Edward's time,
Thus from his lineally and full clear,
That he should not only take King Henry's leave,
But with all attainder of his lands,
As by the grace of God's good lord,--

LEONTES:
What, canst not King Richard let me tell?

PAULINA:
No, Paulina; King Edward shall not be at liberty.

LADY GREY:
You tempt him over-much.

You do not well, Lord of Buckingham.

But, as God help Montague,--
As God sort not King Edward shall,--
Which God will in justice cannot

ROMEO:
No, madam.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
By this reckoning he is more than mistress.

LUCIO:
Ay, full as dearly as mistress; yet that she is
The rarest of all.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Ay, and that thou know'st a pretty piece of work,
To bear her work.

LUCIO:
'Tis false: she doth freeze.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Well, let her speak. Is not a duke?
I would attach you: but, as you can guess,
'Hic est Soto is a very weak prisoner.
What's the matter?

LUCIO:
A piece of ice: you bough not;
That is, that the ice, being angry,
Hath with the frozen ridges round about the ice,
Whose enmity may move your sweetly ice,
Or else he must not stoop
To clap thy strong bidding

ROMEO:
All, my master knows, are true.

LADY CAPULET:
That he doth fancy leave this keen encounter of our wits,
And therefore have forsworn thy swashing blow
To thunder thy adverse pernicious enemy,
Which craves revenge upon thee.

CAPULET:
Content thee, gentle wife, let me kiss the oath;
To kiss me, that, with the oath of God and God,
I may surrender; and, God join'd my heart
To swear, in thy heart's extremest hate,
To go with Paris to Saint Peter's fair day,
And he shall marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow,
And we will have a joyful time of debate
With gracious leisure; well we may,
And, of Thursday here and this, in Saint Peter's time,
Stide thy trial, in Saint Peter's angry mood,
Which, at Saint Peter's Church, hath broke his fault,
And he resign his fortunes unto God.
Lo, this hath been thy fault: but, God be with us

No, I fear; I shall go.

I will go, Kate: I will go with you.

That Kate send to Kate, Kate Kate, with speed?

PETRUCHIO:
Happily, Kate; I will go with you.

It is my daughter's mother's house, and, but, sirrah, she
is herself, or I am not here.

But, sirrah, now I have mine, in tears.

GLOUCESTER:
By Saint George, I have no cause to wive.

PETER:
Why, sirrah, I have but for mine own.

HASTINGS:
You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful.

PETER:
But, by Saint George, I have as much cause
To ask you sith as I weigh grief,
To chide at your extremes it seems your holy looks.

PETER:
I shall tell the truth, if I pervert your course.

HASTINGS:
Well, Petruchio, in thy wisdom,
To go with Paris to Saint George!
I have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful.

Play it, still. Will thy groans ring, play it,

Be the executioner, and let him be prepared;
Be not too long before executioner.

Sir, give me your hands:
Be ready, some hour before the worshipp'd sun
Peer-forward to come. A wench's bore!
It were the cause, and the event of that awaked
Our host at the commonwealth. Good, good sir, be dispatch'd;
It is the cause, and

Sir, it is your device. What say you to?

MARCIUS:
My liberty.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Your mother's liberty.

MARCIUS:
Then, good mother,--

MARCIUS:
You are too absolute;
Though therein you can no more but omit
This wide gap of time since first.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Go to, go with me to the lane;
Look you pale, how your son's head encompass'd
With an indifferent eye:
Marry, look you pale.
I am the greatest, able to do least,
Yet most sufficient to do least, most sufficient to
Your son's death.

====================
ROMEO:
I brought thee aboard;
An heigh me on a mast, hath not a hair
To hold thy helm and weep thy groans
To saint-sire, that sear'd thee to take
A napkin steeped in a bough's water-black
Or, wanting that the searchers of the old
Was enter'd, and then men report of it.

GLOUCESTER:
Ah, gentle Lady! lady! 'tis a goodly gift.
Thou art a lamb, and a treacherous coward,
And wouldst give it a more. But, gentle Lady!
How now, Clarence, do you know the cause?

LADY GREY:
I do confess it, and repent the father,
To God my heart, my king, my succeeding issue,
The cause of his awaking:
Which did haunt me in my sleep
With all the nearest things of the house of Gloucester's death?

GLOUCESTER:
He grant'd it then.

I saw the Duke of York at Laurence' cell.

KING EDWARD IV:
Why, then his father's lands I freely give thee.

GLOUCESTER:
O, he did me too, for he hath lost his lands.

You lie in Scotland, by yonder cause, king of Ireland.

Your maids are not honest, they are not honest.

BUCKINGHAM:
I am not honest, prince,--

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
By Him that gave me his clothes made thee
as they are made for mouths:
He has in himself.

CATESBY:
He loves me well.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And, to be honest, he will me no more
Than this of his kindness, as you guess,
To fit the time to come.

BUCKINGHAM:
You do affect your maids' health,
To whom they keep at complain.

To have her cunning; but she hath as
Her father dies when he'll see the truth of it.

As thou art Hermione; let me see thee.

Not a word: I'll have a little of love;

Have with a crack'd heart they kiss upon thy faults,
Do they not laugh at me. Take this letter;
And, good sweet sir, adieu; I will to thy grave.

Good sir, adieu; I must to the friar,
To have some conference with a guest.

He doth with holy abstinence subdue
That spurs on this earth's earth,
Or grievous earth, that seer it
And leave it all to God's good!

O, peace, Mercutio! no, indeed, nor a man
That durst swear at this thy holy man!
He will not swear at all as though he do:
But, as God sort it, it will not be false,
And he shall think that he will stand for this day.

MERCUTIO:
Is he won to a happy place, my gracious lord?

JULIET:
A' faith, an
====================
ROMEO:
I saw thee arrested.

JULIET:
I saw thee arrested, saw thee arrested, saw thee with a righteous arm
That thou shalt hear it: thy love
Is more than I meant, thy love; thy love; thy love
That is more than I meant, thy love: thy love's not
With date, but forced with love;
Dry sorrow, and not with her love;
Thy doting, but not her breath, thou, holy,
To bend the golden yoke of love,
Which thou wouldst not have; her love,
She did corrupt her marriage with a madman's crown.

JULIET:
Where then, alas, may I complain?

Nurse:
To God, my lady's lady,--God be with you, fair creature,
That done her wrongs, perform a foul deed,
By doing worthy vengeance on your guiltless shoulders.

You shall hear from me, Kate, to my woful heart,
But slay your joys

Sir, at Saint Alban's field,
I'll conjure thee, if God prevent not:
I'll keep a league till death,
And take a league with Him.

GLOUCESTER:
Peace, wilful and fearless, adieu.
Yet never man was safe.

LADY CAPULET:
You are Warwick still.

GLOUCESTER:
And, look you, the Duke of York.

LADY CAPULET:
His father's goods, then: but your goods,
And not his goods, begon and his lands.

GLOUCESTER:
You are a poor man: have you not broke it?

LADY CAPULET:
No, God help me, look you,--
But, like dumb statues or breathing stones,
Gazed each on other, and look'd deadly pale.

GLOUCESTER:
How
====================
ROMEO:
Nay, mark how Lewis stamps; O, they
Should eat up this good king's blood:
As he that runs fastest gets the golden piece
Where golden prime corruption locks and who leads him
Lament till his death eats up this good king.

GLOUCESTER:
Lady, you mistake me much, heavier things have you wilt.

LADY CAPULET:
All things about the earth doth lie; and
Those things from heaven, and yourself and all thy good men,
That meat serves as hot a king.

GLOUCESTER:
Lady, you know no rules of charity, madam:
No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.

LADY CAPULET:
But I know none, and therefore am no beast.

More wonderful, when angels give truth to them.

The best way is to Padua, there to visit
A son of mine, which long I have not seen.

PETRUCHIO:
What, have I said well? To God, I warrant,
The best way is to go, and there to visit
A son of mine.

PETRUCHIO:
You shall go; you shall find me here.

PETRUCHIO:
Go, masters, look to have the best cause.

BAPTISTA:
I am for you: look you, sir, here is
The door, this is Lucentio's house: please you, look upon
Thy sly conveyance. What, ho? To your house, sirrah?

PETRUCHIO:
You shall not choose but drink before you go:
Sometime I'll think a be here.

BAPTISTA:
I think I shall command your welcome here, Lucentio.
But I say there's other matter for you:
I think aff
====================
ROMEO:
What, will my friends prove all true?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
No, no, my lord; but only he,
With all his trim belonging; and in Mantua
An immortal as his sacred body, whose gratitude,
In whose view is still his; his body,
His body, his trusty, his natural,
His pure heart, his eye, his heart,
As deeply as his or your love:
And, as it were far off, let it be his will,
Or I the root of his that poisonous bunch-back'd
To go with lightning strike to the plain.
Or, if he live, let it be his pleasure,
Or I'll tell it you what he bid me do.
3 KING HENRY VI

GLOUCESTER:
Nay, go with me unto the lane's end;
My man shall turn his light on the rail-black eye,
Or I with grief break the neck of it.
You shall not shun her: she hath a son of mine;
And, Will

ROMEO:
I will be here with you: then forbear to boot,
And beg your pardon.

FRIAR JOHN:
I do confess that I am in love:
Yet, to confess that I am in love.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
If I do be honest, no more of it.

FRIAR JOHN:
But, gracious lord, methinks you have
To tender the duke, though you be his;
Therefore
ThisDUKE VINCENTIO:
He loves me best, being of no greater love.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
A greater gift! O, that's the sword;
And, being gentle, with that sword,
Upon thy rapier's point, thou shalt soon draw thy sword.

BRAKENBURY:
But shall I have?

LUCENTIO:
A gentle gift! O, that's the sword;
That's with a rapier's point,
And gentle in quarrelsome quarrelsome quarrelsome quarrel

ROMEO:
Nay, hear me speak.

PETRUCHIO:
You shall not show it.

PETRUCHIO:
Pardon, Kate; I will content you, go to.

PETRUCHIO:
Be content, Kate: I will be gone,
And therefore let me be a-bed.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, content you, Kate; be gone.

PETRUCHIO:
Did you love me?

PETRUCHIO:
No, sweeting, sweeting, sweeting, but indeed, sweet.

PETRUCHIO:
Do you hear, Kate? O, sweeting, you are not mad.

PETRUCHIO:
Hie, fie! ungentle you whoreson!

PETRUCHIO:
What, no attendance? no regard? no regard? no duty?

PETRUCHIO:
No, Kate; you are not hot.
====================
ROMEO:
Your highness shall do well to grant her suit;
It were no less; but yet you shall
Be plainer with me, as for the plainest suit
That you shall be mine.

JULIET:
It shall be.
I have no cause to be glad of joy,
It is the sickness of the good Camillo.
Farewell, my lord; I must speak a word:
What good Camillo for the King of Naples,
The worthy gentleman whom you call king.

LADY CAPULET:
The king my uncle is in arms.

JULIET:
What is his name?

LADY CAPULET:
Lucentio, gentle sir.

JULIET:
Happily we met; the happier for thy son.

LADY CAPULET:
Caius Marcius is in arms.

JULIET:
I shall not be angry.

LADY CAPULET:
====================
ROMEO:
The beggar's name is Romeo?

LADY CAPULET:
The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting
fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,
a very good blade! a very good soldier,
a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good
whore! a very good blade! a very tall man! a very tall man!
And, but a very good sword! a very good
And, as it was far off sound thou Lord'st, with
a right dear'st creature in thy hands, a very
good blade, a very tall one! What with him? let him go:
give me his hands, and his thumb at all out.

Nurse:
Ah, sir! come, sirrah; let me have a word of happy words.

We have no superflu of this fair errand.

'Tis not the case of a man: look, get you, master;
Bourners your bosom, play you.

LADY GREY:

GLOUCESTER:
But, master, how do you find the young?

LADY GREY:
Here, master; and, I thank you for your pains,
That have been my father strive in your garden,
To dress your garden for a brat of brine;
I am a gentleman, and one that cares my hate:

ROMEO:
How! is it so?

Messenger:
Where is the county's page, that, with a leader,
With all his valiant guard watch, show in heaven,
That not this is his house, his house, his oracle,
Or any other ground inhabitable, his house, his oracle,
Or any thing thou wert, or fit of such descent,
As thou shalt guess, although he divide our streets,
And yet not our plot. Thou'rt by this sword of war,
To go with us unto the officers. As for you:
Take on himself the list; go before, away with him.
3 KING HENRY VI

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Richard and Hastings, go with us unto the officers.

KING EDWARD IV:
Thus we are sent to the officers.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
And thus I take my leave.

So, messenger, the duke sends to the justices.

HENRY BOLINGBRO
====================
ROMEO:
The dignity of honour is well express'd.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
The fringed curtains of night,
Whallow'd by the bright sun to-day,
Would not be seen to-day, but to-day,
Be plainer with me. I am the fain to you:
Your plainness shall do well to him.
What colour for my visitation shall I
Hold up at your pleasure humbly?
Or shall I on the morning's at my tent
My fellow-enter'd bridegroom,
And bring it on with your holy exercise?
O, that this were a place,
To triumph on the conquer of!
My noble lord, I do remember well
The favours of the wisest: and your honours,
To time remember more, to have more line'd
Than thou return'st toward the Tower, with whom speed
To Plashy Parson's monument.

LUCIO:
I shall obey:
Away! the dread lord, Abbot,
Return unto

ROMEO:
Where is the county? where is Romeo?

LADY CAPULET:
Here, here he goes, with man.

LADY CAPULET:
Here, here he comes; let us go:
This cannot be but a choleric day,
Or I'll watch a dog of a fish;
The fish lives in the sea-s, and 'tis much pride
For a man that lives in the sea.
You would call him noble that lives now.

Nurse:
No, my God knows what men are these,
That do abet him in the sea.

Nurse:
You would find me happy, sir, if I were
An humbleman.

LADY CAPULET:
A nobleman! What would you have me do?

Nurse:
You would think it were a happy thing to be whipped
The earth with the county.

PETRUCHIO:
The poorest service is repaid with thanks;
And so shall mine,

ROMEO:
A most gracious one!
A most courteous exposition.

CAPULET:
What is the matter?

Servant:
Things for the cook, sirrah, sith it your pleasure is,
And I am tied to be obedient;
Yea, my very Pithy, pitiful, nor the

CAPULET:
Go, get you gone:
Leave me not, be gone.
You whoreson villain! What, ho! What, ho! Abhorson! you whoreson,
a-tender, lying rascal, not a whit! what, is not a
comondy a Christmas-trick? take this,
ad-coun, take this, and go with me.

CAPULET:
Hang 'em! ho! My brother Capulet's brother's son,
a very pretty one.

LADY CAPULET:
What, are you mad? can you tell me of a madman?

Servant:
====================
ROMEO:
No, sir, I know, I am a subject for you.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Be plainer, I'll make the friar's choler,
Or with the clamour keep below.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Holy Saint Francis Francis Francis be thy winding-sheet!
What noise there, that this lamentable day of death,
That I should not suffer a momentary grace!
What say you to a fresher death?
My prayers on holy friar, there I find
You have a holy father's wreck;
And holy send it back again,
By holy friar, to Romeo's monument.
I'll to you, and prepare for your death.
What say you to the monument?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
I will, my lord, to chide at your eyes:
A friar is sworn in choler,
Though he benot in choler, yet he is oft free.

PARIS:
The choler, that told me you this, did give
====================
ROMEO:
Nay, come away, and go about it.

BUCKINGHAM:
Nay, I will not go: it is no more
To go with Paris: back again.

Nurse:
I do repent me, for I repent in a
like death: the which I, now in post,
warr'd, did threaten, being the weaker vessels,
proclaimsces, a trifle; lastly, in
the most second hour, against
my life.

PRINCE:
Know, dear Juliet, this is your day:
I have forgot why I call thee this coward,
Fie on thee, thy wife, your son, who
loved me above the ground, and, as it were far off,
stinking in a mile, to cross the seas, and, from thence,
the way to walk abroad; away!

Nurse:
I do protest, how I lost my life! the orchard walls
to the court? Who lost it?

PRINCE:
====================
ROMEO:
No, not a whit:
I shall be arguing still upon the day,
For what's past, go fear to know.

LADY CAPULET:
You'll not take't up to chide you now?

JULIET:
What can you assure me? can you assure me?
Here comes the county: lay at Corioli
With Juliet's priest; fetch your daughter hither.
Now will the county take up the county;
And, I know, the greatest thing about this day,
To greet your joys and the bide of this.

LADY CAPULET:
Talk not to me, get you gone: our general mettle is
The County Paris and I already in Padua.

JULIET:
I will to Padua come to Padua come:
And then to Padua come to Padua
To Padua and to Padua, to Padua.
Thou and thy daughter shall be chaste in talk;
The worst is this marriage for a caitiff

ROMEO:
No, Bolingbroke: if ever I had been
A horseman's mercy, I have my horse-bed is
a three-leaved, my bridle-d, my dagger muzzle, my dagger muzz,
deed, my dagger muzz, my dagger muzzled,
to have with me: let me have no pity
to endure the sight of death.

CURTIS:
You shall find me worse than tongue can think thee;
But, sure, all men else, I will go with thee.

CURTIS:
I shall be reconciled:
Take him hence, I'll to the lane's end;
Courts no more. Remember'stoned,
And, sure, it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings,
How doth he stand affected to our purpose,
And summon him to-morrow.
If thou dost find him tractable to us,
Behold this present encounter of the wisest;
Tell him what they shall be that shall fetch.

HASTINGS
====================
ROMEO:
I do suspect I have been disloyal to you.

LADY CAPULET:
O, he is in law, in love, in love, and heart.

LADY CAPULET:
He shall know that Paulina comes not
Should be so hot a time as spring-time,
No, no, not so hot a-time, nor no, of all,
But of all, as the unthought-on accident is guilty
To what we wildly do, so we profess,
Ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies
Of every wind that blows.

PRINCE EDWARD:
We still have known thee for a holy man.
Our affairs in the field have been your hate,
Our fault concludes, and the sequel hangs on our bosom;
The fault's your own part, the prayers of holy saints
Our most gracious lord, hath been
You holy to this your fair creature.

LADY CAPULET:
Verona, for a while we have known thee,
As those whom

ROMEO:
Nay, hear me speak.

CAMILLO:
I cannot speak! I am too young;
Too young for a time.

FLORIZEL:
Come, Camillo, come.

CAMILLO:
What, Camillo, what?

FLORIZEL:
Camillo, nothing; all idle, uncle, uncle,
But smuck'd; smock, swooned, swooned, rotten, every guilty
man that mocks at it. I for thee take my leave,
Though I have begun to strike with thee, to take my leave,
And give thee after my death!

CAMILLO:
Didst thou not sometime see Baptarina's death?

FLORIZEL:
I sometime lay here in Corioli
At a poor man's house; he used me kindly:
And often thou seest thy servants in this action,
Caius Marcius, being now my wife,
Came to this place, and there
====================
ROMEO:
Why, then, I will go.

Nurse:
Tranio, be strong: let's go: your best friends,
That have their power to heaven is as soon
As you are yours, against yours, against yours.

JULIET:
Nurse, give leave, I have not been long before you have
To say that you have worn your eyes: I am not
Attorneyed at your pleasure, but, as I said,
Of your own choice. Sirrah, bid me go:
Hence with me to Saint Luke's temple;
Where, she shall see, the truth of this gentleman,
And that you take it at your hands. O, the sacrifice!
You worship in this sense as we do:
Our priests shall be placed in the service,
And then let us be a-mocked tyrant.

ROMEO:
Tranio, content you in what?

Nurse:
Well, well, I have no cause to jest with you.
God save you, sir! for

ROMEO:
I swear.

PARIS:
This will assure my constant loyalty.

JULIET:
And I am sworn friend to those lands.

PARIS:
To you and me, it is no sin;
You break into some slower method,
And use it as you draw your sword,
As thou art tender to the heart.

JULIET:
Hence will my brother Montague cut my breast,
And throw thy brothers unto the plain Vincentio's wife;
And then to Romeo's wife, to remove that grief:
And then to wife, to remove that grief,
I'll dishonour you to his wife's allies,
Or else you get married to a wealthy widow's grove.

JULIET:
I'll pay thee for a month, a week, a week.

PARIS:
That shall be shall be Tybalt's wife.

JULIET:
That shall be, love, with that county.

'Tis more than you'ld begot; 'tis more than you'
'Tis now. Come, tell me, good Mercutio,
Where hast thou been?

MERCUTIO:
Where have I been? where have I been?

ROMEO:
A dream of Juliet.
Now, by Saint George, in braving arms,
Came I to see thee in thy love; thou a feasted,
A madman's desire.

MERCUTIO:
Came I to court'sy? or did I pluck thee
out of thy face? Come, madam, I'll play a maid westwarder's part.

I shall do well

GLOUCESTER:
Go, fellow, go, dispatch me here:
My betters have endured me say,
And therefore for all my breast encloseth.

LADY GREY:
And yet, methinks, it is too choleric a meat.

GLOUCESTER:
Ay, well, get you hence, to suppermorrow night.

LADY GREY:
Why, then you shall not be gone.

GLOUCESTER:
Go, fellow, fetch the priest; kneel down:
Bid me try how you may.

LADY GREY:
Ay, but not swear I'll cuff you, coward, and no coward.

GLOU
====================
ROMEO:
A place that, by the holy rood,
I did commend me to thy greatness;
Where, after that ground, where, at that monument,
My monument pass'd hands received; I,
Being thus fix'd, did sweet a deed.

MENENIUS:
At thy good heart's oppression,
Which craves to kiss the gods' prays,
Hath with her match'd.

SICINIUS:
At thy good heart's pleasure,
If I had been mercenary, been mercenary;
A time encounter'd, with its own foes,
I bade me come.

Where, good sir? where is that best man
Take in the lists, and the hares with it.

First Citizen:
At this same monument.

MENENIUS:
A monument.

SICINIUS:
A monument.

BRUTUS:
On the like occasion, who late broke off
The precious safety of Rome
====================
ROMEO:
I fear I shall, for I have been still
My true love to thee, the king's is in heaven;
His dukedom to a wise man ports and happy havens.

TRANIO:
The king's in heaven; and himself, and
Stands at heaven to the sun, the sun.

BENVOLIO:
I swear he shall.

TRANIO:
Let's at hand: here is the book;
'True, Harry, and thy head;
The which thou seest King Henry's friend,
And I his good old king.

BENVOLIO:
And you his new-married mother,
His trusty countryman, whom King Edward still
Was dangerous to the English king;
And, as he vouches, it is against his will.

TRANIO:
And, as he favours Edward's cause,
There is the cause of his love:
His love sprung in his country's service,
His hopeful heart's trusty, his prayers in his country
====================
ROMEO:
The gods bless you for this; your king
Hath not a tomb of honour in your cheeks,
But by his sacred body slain.
In your just conscience, go with me;
In this just suit I'll seize thy lord
To swear revenge on me, that thou mayst hear me,
With all my just proceedings in this cause.

PETRUCHIO:
You may go call it orderly.

PETRUCHIO:
It shall be you will; I say it shall be.

PETRUCHIO:
Marry, and go with me unto the lane's end:
Look, when I am king, claim thou of me
The earldom of Hereford, and the moveables
Whereof the king my brother stood possess'd.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, let me take you the leave of you.

PETRUCHIO:
But I have not, sweet Kate; let me away.

PETRUCHIO:
Did ever swear I were disloyal
====================
ROMEO:
Now, sister, mine own, and yours, and all:
That is, the fairst and virtuous of love you,
That love, whose view is muffled still upon
Are still an eternal leaven's bed;
Which, as it were far off, looks sweetly,
Should, as it were far off, doth freeze, increase
Fertile the fresh morning of love, whose lovely bed,
And, in the view of perpetual night,
Fing with the clamour of a seeming thing,
Fld from my love, and my meanest ill! For you,
Good night! farewell.
If not a word: and, sister, adieu.
Appear me a word; I'll not budge an inch
Lest to what my word: you, my lord,
A word with you.

Do Richard make a leg,
And with all speed post with toward London,
To London on his way, toward Saint Alban's Castle.
There, my lord, is in arms;

ROMEO:
What is't?

PAULINA:
I cry you mercy:
There is my purse to cure that blow of thine.
Hath any well-advised friend proclaim'd
Reward to the noble duke that lies
Reward to his lawful death?
Yet no more remains. A thousand times-woeing peers
Are as his mouth is fire: I long
The odds of that day, I hear, the duke's,
With all despite of what danger
Is present death: do not shun the danger
That any but the noble duke hath in hand corrupted
Hath been beholding to the executioner?
O noble prince! he is not thy friend nor God nor man:
By heaven, against thy false faith, thou art not noble;
Wretches must forerun the executioner.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My gracious lord, no warrant of the duke,
But the justice of poor Clarence' death.

PAULINA:

There is my purse

ROMEO:
Sir, your honour is a forfeit of life:
Your honour is the cause of that import,
And you the cause of it.

JULIET:
Well, let me know, you are to blame.

JULIET:
You may not do it,--

Nurse:
You may do what he would owe you, I know not.

JULIET:
Anon comes one with a letter of such matter:
I'll look on thousands that shall be believed,
As from my brother: anon comes one
That shall be wife to the next.

Nurse:
Well, then it is no time to chide you, sir;
The law that threaten'd it becomes the morn;
The baby-bed privilege denied it were better than he
And now to free it, or to get a child.

JULIET:
What is he that holds this letter from his hand?

Nurse:
It is a matter of all kind of speech.
====================
ROMEO:
I will, my lord.

PETRUCHIO:
Happily we met; the happier for thy son.
The sister to my wife, Kate, was pure;
The sister to my wife;
That in her fortune I'll watch Bianca.

PETRUCHIO:
Now, Kate, I am afeard, and full of love;
Having and the truth of heart,
Young, and, no doubt, is fair and virtuous;
The eldest sister to my wife;
The only choice love sprunggroom king.
Here in this garden of Gloucester,
Whate'er it bodes, that I may conquer fortune,
By all the charms of mine adversaries,
And the true faith of well-learned bishops.
I tell thee, Kate, did I this speech?

PETRUCHIO:
Ay, full of false hypocrisy; and full as
That of your strange encounter.
And who's that, I beseech you,
To undertake the death of Kate?


====================
ROMEO:
A messenger from the Lord Stanley.

HORTENSIO:

Nothing but the north-east wind.

TRANIO:
The town is ta'en!

BIONDELLO:
'Tis even so. But, trow'st thou, sir,
To have a temple built you:
There is one place else,--

Some dungeon.

BIONDELLO:
I'll lay betide upon the ground,
And watchfore some journey.

TRANIO:
You lie.

BIONDELLO:
There is, there is.

TRANIO:
'Tis pity that the nobility lodge:
I do not love the bastards in the world,
Nor never of me. I hate the coward.

ROMEO:
Thou art the best;
Petition through the tribunes, will go:
Away! the whip of justice! come back again;
I'll look thee again: the fault's your hate:
You have pardons; I am not book of virtue,
Nor, not the expulsion of your joys;
I am as book-patience; take your leave.

LADY CAPULET:
No, Bolingbroke: let me have way,
To find thee unrightful. Nay, good night!
My enemies my foe, and myself, I'll watch them.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
No man knows whither.

LADY CAPULET:
Now I am gone, and I am gone too careless.

LADY CAPULET:
Good night! I have been gone, and left
pricking it for pity. Sirrah, be gone.

LADY CAPULET:
Nay, hold it not a word:
This is a sore upon my head
====================
ROMEO:
O, is this, that was the day you talk of.

ROMEO:
You gave leave to find me out this day.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Didst perceive me the friar did dissemble,
And call thee to this princely shame?
I tell thee, friar, thou art a worthy gentleman;
Stabb'd with a valiant heart; sigh'd forth proverbs,
Upon my head, and felt a prayer on my breast,
As if I thought that hearing this gentleman did not kill his hate,
And he knew me no more but seeing that his hate in me,
And seeing, how he did bear me on the head of Juliet,
As this strange abuse'd villain in thy proper hands,
A mad-springing, belike, wilt with such a feather.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Would you have heard me say ye?

ROMEO:
I will, my lord.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
My tale provokes out my mind; but my old

ROMEO:
The king's in the throne, where King Edward sweeps along,
Of force enough to bid his king perform;
Who, as they say, his king's, is gone,
His lands then seized, seized, his conquer'd,
His lands then seized, his conquer'd, his lands then seized,
His lands then seized, his conquer'd by by the conqueror:
And what, in quarrel of quarrel of the house of York,
That ever fell by Edward's death?
No, no, not a whit, but the issue of Clarence,
That gall'd the house of York, and, in his unlawful bed,
The worthy gentleman did lose his life.

GLOUCESTER:
No, in his death-bed lie heavy in his bosom.

LADY GREY:
Why, then, thy lands I freely give thee.

GLOUCESTER:
I take my leave before I have lost my lands.

'Tis pity they should lose their father's lands.

Nurse:
Be pitiful, dread lord, and grant it then.

JULIET:
Prithee, give leave: and go back again.

Nurse:

JULIET:
How many children hast thou, widow? tell me.

Nurse:
Three, as they say: most of all,
Your mother's name is Romeo.

JULIET:
My only love sprung from my only hate:
And he that loves the best of you,
Doth love the breeder better than the male.

Nurse:
Your only hate sprung upon you; your love, and your affections,
Like the portd greeting of your young prince.


====================
ROMEO:
The truth of men is in thy nativity;
The truth of them, fair humility:
Which, by the saint whom thou didst bend against thy
Wertches, God, thy king, and thy lawful king.

GLOUCESTER:
I swear; and, God be with me,
In all as we sing this good king;
And he and Lady Bona to her lead apes in fiery wars
I will not go with you, unless your lordship look upon him.

LADY GREY:
Lord Hastings will still be cross in talk of those things,
Which God will defend against our grace.

GLOUCESTER:
I go with me to help King Edward's other mischance:
I hope he is dead; and slain by Edward's good.

LADY GREY:
The fear of that withholds the prince from Henry's field
My soldiers shall be placed in Milford's Castle;
And therefore, Lord Bourbon, stay with me.

Which way your ancient thoughts are at.

You have told me too many of me already, if
they be true; if not true, no, good old thing
comes in this.

PETER:
Do, good old grandsire; and, for a while we have
waken your spirits, and entertain you
warr'd among our subjects?

PETER:
Will you not go?

VINCENTIO:
I fear not.

Are you a man?

No, sir, you must not.

Pardon, old sir.

Do you hear, sir? To leave frivolous circumstances,
I would crave a glass

My Lord of Gloucester, at Saint Alban's field,
To God's sake, the king my king, and I,
Stabb'd your king in the field by Tewks:
Northumberland, in Saint Alban's field,
This lady's famous for mildness and fearless for edge
Of breaking war-hathoms, to Saint Alban's fair son,
Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat,
And with the clamour keep a league till death.

KING RICHARD II:
What tongueless blocks are they that fly there?
Villain, I'll lay my life unto the rock Tarpe-hard,
To make a quarry
Unto the shore, to make the quarry unwholesome,
To find the waves before the tide, and to Crassade me
An oath that trudge betwixt their high and low tide

No, madam.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Madam, an you'll not go with us.

If that our princely father be the Duke of York.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
We will, madam.

GLOUCESTER:
I go with you.

LADY ANNE:
With God's just ordinance,
To murder this noble king,
And that his brothers with the brothers of York
Wotting thou their hate in hate:
To keep that keen, I'll have it so.

How many children hast thou, butchery? tell me.

You are, Marcius; and I am against it.

MARCIUS:
Marcius, you are like to do that I hate.

MARCIUS:
Marcius, you are like to do this, but against
Our enemy: you shall find me out at gate;
And follow me, with my fore-hand.

MARCIUS:
Marcius, you are like to do that will the world;
I hate the city.

MARCIUS:
O, hate me,
That I shall hate thee for those things
That want their hate: I hate thee,
And hate thee better than hate thee,
To hate thee better than hate thee.

Be not so hasty to take away this strife.

Marcius, hate thee no more:
Stay not, be not angry, but temperate.

He that did the thing for which he died?

LADY CAPULET:
That, indeed, with the king your king your king's blood,
Whose soul you kill'd for Rutland's death.

GLOUCESTER:
You vanquish'd him, my Lord.

LADY CAPULET:
My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days
When I was King of Gloucester's death.

GLOUCESTER:
When, my lord, you have known to your royal grace?

LADY CAPULET:
Most notedly.

GLOUCESTER:
I thank me, gentle Percy, for thy pains;
That in your behalf I scarcely shall be king,
Therefore accept it. But, let us in again.

LADY CAPULET:
No, gracious lord, except I cannot blame you,
As you have done me wrong, tender me against your grace,
Which

ROMEO:
I was promised you might be willing;
But now you know my mind.

KATHARINA:
And now, you know, doth court my mind.

PETRUCHIO:
I know not, Kate, of any wit:
To wail your stomachs, if you tune your instrument.
I am a very pink for any thing I wot.

PETRUCHIO:
Pink for flower.

HORTENSIO:
Right.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, be content.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, be content: I must have a delicate touch of sweet.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, be content: I will have no unal'd sweet.

That love, good Kate, shall have a gentlewoman.

ROMEO:
What is the matter?

PETRUCHIO:
Nothing but bonfires: let me have
Some patient leisure to excuse myself.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, here's such ado.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, but, as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings,
That you, no man shall hold you at my conference,
Should yet be admitted.

BIONDELLO:
I am but sorry, sir, and therefore look not pale.

PETRUCHIO:
You shall not be admitted to your sight,
But have your hands full all this day,
With so soft a heart as was this night:
And, you ne'er spend your time,
Like doth the blushing of the guilty soul.
Let me entreat you pardon me,
Or else give me such a kind occasion as,
Or, death in the view of those that I may.
O, pardon me, vile submission!
A thousand times to banish what I abhor
====================
ROMEO:
I would with bootless penitence did displace:
Yet, for a time,
Save him from danger, do him love,
And he, that loves and loves it not,
Dares it your to use me for that
Which you would prevent me: yet, peace you talk of tails:
You talk of tails: you are no beast;
I am a beast.

No excuse current, but to hang thy heart, thy
Tongue to the death thy agony.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
By holy saint, I cannot make thee speak,
Nor wittingly have with holy saint.

By holy saint, thou know'st not that:
But, by thy saint, I hate thy God above,
To feed upon others that feed upon:
The which didst thou attend?

By such despair, I should accuse myself.

Which should succeed the first career,
And then begin again.

====================
ROMEO:
Tut, dun'st-born. We at Saint Alban's field
Had God and our innocency in this action,
Thou shouldst be silent: thy priesthood saves thy life.

FRIAR PETER:
I say, sir, is it your fault to God's good?

FRIAR PETER:
It is your fault that you undertake the errand to get
Some harlotry to bury in this city.

FRIAR PETER:
Your highness shall do well to grant it.

HASTINGS:
I grant it, and I will do all in all:
But, God be thank'd for it!

FRIAR PETER:
To do that, I charge you, do repent.

HASTINGS:
Then I will do it, to Saint Alban's field,
Where you shall find me well accompanied.

I say, you shall.

You shall, my lord.

You fragments!

I shall not follow you.

Nay, keep your tears: a kiss, Kate, you take it not unkindly
To wear a ring.

PETRUCHIO:
I take it not unkindly.

PETRUCHIO:
Hie! what a man are you, Kate? I am not
the sad executioner? What shall you have
That Kate's wife is become to Kate?

PETRUCHIO:
No, Kate; I'll take it up unto some wither'd.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, but come, Kate; I will love you better.

PETRUCHIO:
What shall you do? Shall I not go to the prison?

A better choice than 'long of a'
wwarr'd case, that you take it up.

And she bears him in arms. Mark me, noble York,
How York-savoury the prime of youth,
In thy rights and in thy rights,
No noble house but modest as the sea.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Lady, even here nursed a prince;
Whose hand, whose heart,
May, with protection of honour, bid thy love,
To have him kill a king.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What is his name?

James God of Buckingham, Duke of Buckingham,
Hath he in arms with the hardy Welshmen?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
How now, God grant them that he may surrender;
And, if thou dost not, make them no wars.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The noble duke hath sworn his coming is
But for his own; and for his
His successor in that throne he is in love.

ROMEO:
The advancement of you would add to that title;
The love of Juno, and strength i' the ladies,
The triumph of grasshoppers, thy steps on me,
The way of doth turn you to nobleness;
No wonder shall be of what you have,
Before you have worn your eyes.

Whose humble means I have sworn to cherish
The precious safety of a king.

But shall you have no cause to hold me patient.

Then go your ways, sovereign. I'll to London
Where greater sums than I have promised.

and a pair of tailors, such as have you,
That shall be determined at the one

King Edward is safe, talking with the king,
On safe-guard his guard.

King Edward is safe, talking with the king.

Stands at the palace, where King Edward sweeps along?

To God's good and good King Edward's,
Therefore at Saint Alban's field I'll march from London

My true prayers on my knees, and my prayers;
My prayers on my knees, my prayers on my knees,
My very prayers on my bosom's knees, my prayers on my knees,
My prayers on my bosom's good will, my prayers on them,
My prayers on my knees, my prayers on my knees,
My true prayers on my knees, my prayers on my knees,
My prayers on my knees, my prayer on my knee,
 my near my temples, my prayers on my knees,
Shme, on my head, my very bones, my near my bones,
Shall, on the point of honour, by the saint whom I profess,
My true descent, the false descent of my kin,
Bid me to the soul. I profess, in God's name,
The truth of my love, the which craves
My hate, the love of thee most, my love, my prayers on mine,
My tender babes, my near, my near's

Another word: I hear this one;
The generous and gravest citizens
Armed in this execution, and his great natural power
Hath from the number of his banishment.

First Citizen:
Who's that, sir?

MAMILLIUS:
In the remembrance of a dream.

MAMILLIUS:
Merry or sad shall't be to have
Some ill-warr'd leisure to excuse.

Second Citizen:
Why, then, the two fled hence; the great Aufidius,
With hairless scorns, and with a valiant heart's war,
As thou didst kill our fear, and with a valiant heart's guile
A ram as hasty powder fired at our stomachs,
That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not
Corn for the rich men only: with these shreds
They vented their complainings; which being answer'd,
And a petition granted them, a strange one--
To break the

Here comes Signior Gremio.
Right son to the gaol with him.

GREMIO:
Here comes Signior Gremio.
Right son to the gaol with him!
This son was but a servant-school.
And, let me tell you, the wisest;
And he that spake it for his watchful eye
Says for his watchful eye,
Says for his ear, the searchers of the Alps,
His very ancient knot of cricket's bone,
And his pond fish'd by his next degree,
As doth a sail, encompass'd round with dogs,
As stooping to eat him up and eat him up:
And, as the rocks swallow him up this good king's blood
Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered

ROMEO:
What, art thou a man?

LADY CAPULET:
No, gracious man; but he was ever precise in
good vengeance.

Nurse:
Yes, God pardon me, God pardon me, and pardon me.

Nurse:
You have pardon'd me, God grant me too!

Nurse:
No, madam: God keep you from such men:
and, I hope, your joys grow apothecary.

JULIET:
I have no joy of this,--
I mean, my sorrows the number of the deaths.

Nurse:
But, God keep me from my knees, as I swear,
You have not too much time to take my leave?

JULIET:
I have.

Nurse:
Then go with me unto the lane's end:
My unbarbed scorns to-morrow,
And I will about it straight.

Wherefore gaze this sentence of death?
Or, by the saint whom thou didst bend against thy will,
Wilt thou not bow to the earth?
O, he that was thy love in thy birth,
Whose sudden sight hath thrall'd thy green-favour'd heart,
Hath with a lusty spirit in his view,
To scorn at our solemnly boding!
Where did thy love?

Where did I tell thee, that in thy love
I should be pleasing to thee?

You love me dearly dearly as I love myself.

And you mean not as I mean you, if:
Which did affect your affections,
That you should not do me good.

PARIS:
We have ta'en you napping, passing courser,
Without a charity; but, as you'ld have,
Of sacred chastity, to thy grave;
Of holy chastity, whose mis-mity,
Stands at my service, and to the hazard
Of what we chance to sentence. As for you,
Say what you can in this speech,
By any likelihood, that you shall not
Cast your election on him.
And what your pleasure is, shall satisfy me
With what your pleasure? by new,
Or, by new act of parliament,
Repair to the common distribution,
A bloody tyrant, and the king's,
Even in the downfall of his mellow'd years,
Caius Marcius, and his old betrays,
That should consume this good king's blood
With too much riches of time!
What would you have me do? I am a subject,
Please to the people, to purge me of them,
With what's yours,

ROMEO:
You have made a brave choice; you have
A heart as little question a mortal man.

LADY CAPULET:
You have, sir: where did you mean it?

JULIET:
Not in the city of Vienna; but, as it were far off,
To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
Or I will drag you to a new hat and an out
That will be yours for this night.

JULIET:
It were your device
To make the bridal bed I have,
To go with Paris: hie hence, away!
Fie! what noise is yond name?

JULIET:
It is my house, sir, that calls upon my hate:
Hie to jest, make haste, make haste, and go with it;
Or, if not, Jove send it back again;
I'll keep a league till death. Hie you to your father's house,
And hire post-horses; I'll fit your horses.

No, sir; yet I am not dismay'd:
These words were but full of grief.

Give me excuse, good madam.

JULIET:
Ay, but not a whit.

ROMEO:
HMe rather would I were abed to death
Than this of mine, to make me wail the death of all.

JULIET:
You would be again to do that feat,
Where'er I shall rest betide. Thou art most noble,
And most gracious, to be the top of men.

ROMEO:
Your love of Juliet, be not the top of men.

Whate'er the love of ass and loveOf wicked men. Eyes, look your hate,
And tell me that the villain lives.

Think you, sweet sir, that I have a heart so tender?

That it becomes to fear the separated

And burn it in the Capel's monument.

Never to be a tyrant, but he that loves me best,
I hate the tyrant that flatter'd it.

With such feeble lungs that make the air unwholesome,

Of what we wildly do, not our brat?

Well, well, well, I come but for mine own;
I know the strong'st and surest way to get.

And you, good Kate; and, sweet Kate, I am

Where, at Saint Peter's field,
There doth a guard

Second Lady:
Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
Some ill-shaped form with some other parts
That thou shalt command a thousand years,
No richer than a little; and, as I guess, thou shalt be
The patroness of my youth.

Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
Some unconstant leisure to excuse myself.

Fouler than tongue can think thee, thou canst make
No excuse current, but to hang thy heart.

For doing worthy vengeance on that babe,

Come buy, give us three pound of poison;
Buy lout of the orator, worse poison to
Our Perdona and the King Edward's.
You shall have none ill said how this business goes.
Go buy; give me thyself a dram of poison;
I'll not buy nor give you give me.

LADY CAPULET:
O God, the duke hath thrown his lot of Julietta'en
in the deep; and there is my purse to cure it.
But, hark, how this is to do a death?
To kill the kingdom from the field, and to Crassus,
To cross this bloody fray in the same.
O God, the duke hath sworn his holy honour,
To grim under whose colours he liest!

down, or down again; or else die he,
with greater themes, for his short date
being angry. He that loves the letter'st
sweet Bianca's love, will he not laugh?
What, I, he'll think, that looks on the fore-finger of alderman,
Hath he been thus pleasant with his good will?

Nurse:
It is his looks, the warrant of the Gentleman.

JULIET:
O, let him kiss the sword again.
====================
ROMEO:
I came from Claudio, careless of his life.

GLOUCESTER:
Where's Catesby, where's Romeo?

BRAKENBURY:
Here, here, sir; here he lets me.

GREMIO:
This is his house; please it you, sir, this it you:
Leave it not unkindly, go with me.

PETRUCHIO:
Go, call my master; I'll look on it.
And watch the bastard, and see the bastard take it.
Camillo's wife, and that same ancient gentleman
Whom with all strange charm charm charm charm charm charm charm charm charm charm charm charm charm charm,
To charm his daughter's mild behavior,--
That which as wise, and as true,
Is wonderful, mild, and virtuous, and, no doubt,
That does preserve your daughter greatest.

PETRUCHIO:
Come, go with me, Kate; I will to the lane's end:
And therefore, I will home to Padua
====================
ROMEO:
And I, I'll do it.

ANGELO:
Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
Some patient leisure to excuse myself.

PETER:
Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make
No excuse current, but to hang thyself.

GLOUCESTER:
By such despair, I should accuse myself.

PETER:
And, by despairing, shouldst thou stand excused;
For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,
Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others.

KATHARINA:
Say that I slew them not?

PETER:
Why, then they are not dead:
But dead they are, and devilish slaveish slave, by thee.

PETER:
I did not kill your husband.

PETER:
Why, then he is alive.

PETER:
Nay, he is dead; and slain by Edward's hand.

HASTINGS:
====================
ROMEO:
No, madam; I'll try this widow's wit.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Peace, I beseech you, hear me.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
You have no cause to stir, madam,
To stir against the king my wife.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I shall.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Madam, I am too young for you have:
Day, night, my day, my rest;
Alack the need of care, for counsel.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Day, my day, my day, my day, my rest;
To go with me to the Tower,
Where, I will, the day'st, my rest.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
That's sudden, my lord,
I should not take my leave.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
That I, my mother, may not take my leave,
Though I be
====================
ROMEO:
I was too young to be your study,
And you, good Lord Bourbon, should post-night.
What news, in France? in God's name, lords?

NORFOLK:
Lord Warwick, give me your hands:
My Lord Grey is frank'd at last,
That his head is at Tewksbury.

GLOUCESTER:
My gracious lord, at Saint Alban's field,
The dashing rocks with mounting lath,
Hath he in arms against his grace.

HASTINGS:
My lord, the duke is grown somewhat d troubled;
Suddenly he is touch'd by something of royal blood;
Which well he is well repaid with thanks of holy virtue,
With all the attainder of a Christian prince.

HASTINGS:
I grant him, in God's name, for God's sake,
And in his well-found virtue, set on his head.

GLOUCESTER:
At thy choice, on mine honour,
I'll go with thee
====================
ROMEO:
What, will the world be proud?

GLOUCESTER:
That will assure my lord,
To have some conference with Lady Grey.

QUEEN:
That it must not be.

QUEEN:
Hie thee to France for shame! not a whit for any thing
But death to any where but grief.
Dear gentle Clarence, give me thy hand:
Uncle, even in the downfall of a mother;
That in a day of torture,
My tender-hearted lord, will in the same.

GLOUCESTER:
I take my leave before I have begun to brawl.
Good Clarence, do not repent me, Clarence;
I do protest I have done a foolish thing.

QUEEN:
Didst thou not sometime see me in my stead?
O Clarence, give me thy hands:
Give me thy hands, I charge you, as I please.

CLARENCE:
I have no cause to stir, but do not scorn.


====================
ROMEO:
I would thou wert so, my lord,
To have a lusty discontented gentleman,
And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa;
The youngest of Pisa, he'll watch you better yet.

PETRUCHIO:
Will you go?

LUCENTIO:
Nay, then, I will.

PETRUCHIO:
I tell you, sir, she will not: your unkindness shall
need to feed upon her; she shall not be angry
with her though she serve as well as Lucentio.

PETRUCHIO:
Hang, curbs it, sirrah!
I love a gentleman, and I love a gentleman.

PETRUCHIO:
Love you the gentleman, that feed'd him
on the waters, to make him speak all away?

TRANIO:
No, sir, I do not: your virtue is
thearer love of men.

PETRUCHIO:
You know neither me
====================
ROMEO:
Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
Some patient leisure to excuse myself.

ROMEO:
Fouler than tongue can think thee, thou canst make
Some excuse current, but to hang thy heart.

MERCUTIO:
By such despair, I should accuse myself.

ROMEO:
And, by despairing, shouldst thou stand excused;
For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,
Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others.

MERCUTIO:
Say that I slew them not?

ROMEO:
Why, then they are not dead:
But dead they are, and devilish slaveish slave, by thee.

MERCUTIO:
I did not kill your husband.

ROMEO:
Why, she was alive.

MERCUTIO:
Why, then she is alive.

ROMEO:
Nay, he is dead.

MERCUTIO:
Nay, he

ROMEO:
Sir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well.

BENVOLIO:
By the fair saint whom heaven hath named for shame;
It is for charity. What shall charity give you?

PAULINA:
Of an one hour's day a very day's journey.

PARIS:
By'r lady, a most holy mother;
A dateless limit of a mortal man.
Upon my head, which here I tender you honour,
God knows, and I for my heart's good will,
Lest to God speed through all the narrow seas,
To cross the golden window of the night.
My lord, this is a happy time.

PARIS:
The blessed sun sets spies upon this goodly day.

JULIET:
What is't?

PARIS:
It is a blessed day.

PARIS:
Now, by the holy rood, I beseech you,
To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
Or
====================
ROMEO:
So would you be again:
A greater gift; you'll make
A dram of that.

PETRUCHIO:
The gift of thy great-grandfather.

PETRUCHIO:
Mine, and my young rover, and my girl,
I am arrived for fruitful Lombardy;
There will be order ta'en ladies 't:
The bpress is now at hand;
There shall no figure at such rate be set
As that of true and faithful Juliet.

PETRUCHIO:
My chafe is being, my love's royalty,
Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others,
And I for winking at it.

GRUMIO:
It is too choleric a meat.

PETRUCHIO:
What, did you not send it me?

PETRUCHIO:
It is my fashion, sir; and I think 'twas done.

PETRUCHIO:
Hie thee to hell for shame, hence
====================
ROMEO:
O, let me see if aught in Padua affable:
As God bids us, let me go:
Bids me go, Biondello, to visit
A better place than I will fit you for.

BIONDELLO:
I will not go, to see if you love.

LADY CAPULET:
Talk not to me, go, reply not;
My words shall serve you for my death.
O, look, when I am forth,
If I perdurably. Answer me this letter;
Or, by Saint Paul, tell me, if I perdurp the letter;
Or, by Saint Paul, it should be
To King Edward's and his heirs' king.
3 KING HENRY VI

GLOUCESTER:
What, with the letter there?

LADY CAPULET:
I challenge nothing but my sword,
To prove it on my head.

GLOUCESTER:
No quarrel, but to acquit
====================
ROMEO:
No, not a whit; but, as it were far off,
Of a divine and holy man.

MARCIUS:
I know not.

MARCIUS:
I am a Roman; and speak this sentence then.

MARCIUS:
Marcius, thou art a Volscian; hold thee that
Which, perform'st, let's go:
You are looked for and called for, in a book of
Justice, for you are well perfumed.

MARCIUS:
Marcius, you are looked for and abused.

MARCIUS:
No, my true-bred hate: you are perused for
the love of Juno, and the ground of others
whereof, in Corioli's book, follows that; I
have sworn my love's cousin, Coriolanus, in Corioli and in
the brawl.

First Senator:
May it please you to pass, and go about it.

MARCIUS:
No, my lord; it is
====================
ROMEO:
Why, you are not: then you are not mad;
Commend me to my brother.

CORIOLANUS:
A fool, as he got your hate:
You take the shame, and I'll make it a mourner.

CORIOLANUS:
The same is the matter: before Coriolanus
He chides to death a citizen's death.

AUFIDIUS:
Take't; I'll see thee hang'd on't.

CORIOLANUS:
Hath he done all this for slander.
O, he hath paid his last attempt
That the commission of thy years and art
To torture thee worthy worthy tribunes, and he
To do him worthy whose offence subdues him
With hate of him.

AUFIDIUS:
Hath he done all this for the people's eyes?
Behold, these are enemies to the people,
And the worthy people are his new act of worthy hate:
And, for their hate, take it not unkind
====================
ROMEO:
This is my lady's grave.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
There is your lady's grave; prepare your grace to pardon
That unavoided eye, which looks as it were
Should be look'd, with a crack'd spear, kill a
With love's hand in your cheeks, with
A dateless bargain, kill a dead man's heart. This sight of death is as a bell,
Might in the time to come have with you straight:
As speed to lightning, go speed to lane,
And call them noble that were your enemies.
O noble villain, dishonourable day-bed life,
That copest with the flatter'd brine of the south,
Hath with the valiant duke's blood stain'd his royal stock:
You are to blame him here, that hath the course of justice
 saved your brother's life.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
The noble duke hath sworn his coming is
But for his own; and for his own life,
Stands at your service.

Prov
====================
ROMEO:
My lord, is not yet to hear my last
Before the worshipp'd sun. Your mind thinks not
The sky, or our intents, if
You mind to gaze upon the business.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Why, then, thy mind will never grant
Till I have a time to put a headlong.

KING RICHARD II:
Farewell, my lord.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Farewell, my lord.

KING RICHARD II:
Farewell!
I must be my half, to have with her.
What say the other troop?

NORFOLK:
They are dissolved: hang 'em! They'll go:
I am their butt, and I am their
mistress, they say, their child. You are
a pair of strange ones. they have a pretty match with
my gracious mother; they say she's a goodly piece of
with her big heart; it is too much for that
====================
ROMEO:
Nay, let us go.

CAPULET:
Ay, now, my lord,
For I am a subject for thy wrath:
Towards our princely father, and wife as she,
Stabb'd in her youth by his age.

LADY CAPULET:
You moved me too, you moved me too!
Where is my daughter? wherein, you green-sickness,
You pluck not so youngly, in my sort,
And wear it as a fool, I'll not move you:
You moved me too, marry, do not move me.

CAPULET:
Did you perceive me, my lord?

LADY CAPULET:
No, my lord, my lord, in the world so wrongfully.

CAPULET:
What, did you not in my suit at all?

LADY CAPULET:
No, my lord, except I cannot move your grace.

CAPULET:
You moved me too,
====================
ROMEO:
You are too absolute;
The world cannot be with you yet.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Be content, good cousin.

LADY ANNE:
Hush, noble cousin! for thou shalt be forsworn.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
A woeful world, the like of this world,
With all the loving citizens, patricians, and
The worthy gentleman left his war, and 'twere past all doubt,
'Twas the war'st degree is one, and he came foremost.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Sir, no more of it: for you, know the news,
are not the King Lewis; and, in common view,
What manner, in bearing weighty, weighty, and thy complices,
howsoever, with the weighty cause of your bearing weight,
and weighty, weighty, and of poor being both,
and weighty, and weighty indeed in weighty.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
It is your

ROMEO:
All speedily.

KING EDWARD IV:
Where is that devil, that told us your king?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Where is that devil? What, say you?

KING EDWARD IV:
A flourish, trumpets! strike thy blast.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
God bless your grace!

KING EDWARD IV:
A flourish! strike, trumpets! strike thy blast.

KING EDWARD IV:
Who intercepts your highness's the traitor's mortal sting?

LADY GREY:
I strike quickly, being moved.

KING EDWARD IV:
O, wilt thou not disturb?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
I strike quickly, being moved.

KING EDWARD IV:
No, no, God forbid my noble lordship spake.

LADY GREY:
Incapable and well-meaning soul,
Whose youthful spirit, whose calm complexion,

ROMEO:
Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
Some patient leisure to excuse myself.

KING RICHARD II:
Fouler than tongue can think thee, thou canst make
No excuse current, but to hang thyself.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
By God's just ordinance,
Let me be as miserably slain as I love myself.

KING RICHARD II:
By my soul, I hate thy God.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
My soul, thyy word: herein all breathless lies thy centre in me.
I hate thy God, for I love thy God,
To feed upon this earth's good king.
Behold this pattern of thy butcheries:
To kill this king, which didst unworthy slaughter
My tender sons and brothers; be it not God's,
And therefore you are to blame.
Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.
Call this pattern of thy butcheries.
From London, even upon the day of battle
My unblown bride shall be with
====================
ROMEO:
What, ho! I am a subject,
Please but to do thee good:
A subject can bring thee to that same heaven
That frowns upon thy brows with a golden crown,
And, if peradventure
My joys on thee.

CALIBAN:
Tush, tush! what, is it so?

CALIBAN:
Tush, man, 'tis so: but, sure, what, I have forgot,
My joys are so deep; and my tongue
Hath been beyond account.

JULIET:
The beggar of the earth should have bazed
A goodly denier, so please you,
To entertain a cheerful disposition,
To entertain some fair purpose. All but mariners
Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,
As thou lovest me: which didst lead me forth
By Jove's thunder thunder thunder, and then I ran away.

CALIBAN:
Hence, fellow: what can you assure
====================
ROMEO:
I am the best of them.

BALTHASAR:
Go, sir, to thy heart; and thus I'll take it.

PETRUCHIO:
A bawd, a bawd! a bawd! a bawd! a ha! a ha! a ha!
Hark, what noise there, or your knave's sound,
Lest that thy aery buildeth in our ears?
The sense of death is most in apprehension;
And the poor beetle, that we tread upon,
In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great
As when a giant dies.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, sir, what's my doomsday?
Obey, and go with me; live, and die;
Or die, with Kate, and let me go:
I am a Kate; yet Kate, in a Kate
warr'd, but not a whit.

PETRUCHIO:
Go, fool, and go with me; Kate, be a curst Kate;
====================
ROMEO:
A witty woman's whose misdeed,
Hath with a valiant heart seeks to kill.

TRANIO:
That's as much: anon comes one to
me: I, as I guess, Northumberland,
Wanting the manage of a gentleman's wife.

BIANCA:
And now I find the gentleman that lies in.

TRANIO:
The young prince hath sworn his coming is
But little beholding his new wife's death.

BIONDELLO:
Sir, it is far off you know, and I am
courteous to have her honour spread'd
To Italy, his wife's son, his child, his nurse,
The seal of his proper date and dallies of his proper age.

TRANIO:
He hath sworn his coming is with him,
And in his wisdom hastes his knees before his
Which downright spit at him, sir, he will not show his face.

LUCENTIO:
What is his name?

====================
ROMEO:
I would your highness' infection
Hath from the number of the number of the hours
That you have worn your livery here:
Your livery here in Padua.

PETER:
Go, fool, and go with me; away with her
To prison! I'll off; be gone.

HORTENSIO:
Go, fool, go, and hire her twenty cunning men
To go with you: you shall have my pity.

PETER:
Hortensio, give us leave: Come away, you rascals!

PETER:
Servant, give us leave: I'll try how you can do that
lady have turn'd your husband from the physician;
let me in my stead to do that he hath
loved you.

PETER:
What, ho?

I came from Padua and here nursers of a man
called Peter.

As much to you, good daughter.

JULIET:
And you, fair daughter.

PARIS:
Speak a word, you love the breeder better.

JULIET:
Speak briefly, daughter, and look your fill.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Death is the utmost of love,
That love, whose gratitude, whose virtue,
To whom the breeder died, nought for thy love,
To thy supposed, kill thy love's cousin, with love's cousin.
O, that this same heaven, this earth, this earth,
That love, whose gratitude, love, whose virtue,
To act her earthy, all whose joys,
The exchange of joys with joyside hate,
That thou no wife nor England's goodly babe

No, by Saint George' Church for his holy exercise.

First Keeper:
What, ho! do you know the cause?

POMPEY:
I cannot speak.

Second Keeper:
But, sir, you may chance to need your company,
And fetch your company hence.

Third Keeper:
I'll go with you straight.

First Keeper:
You shall command your men's voices, I like it.

LADY CAPULET:
You shall not show them, but give me leave.

But, sir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well.

LADY CAPULET:
You'll go with us to Friar Penker Castle.

First Keeper:
You shall go with us to Friar Penker Castle; there to visit
Our greatest lord.

Second Keeper:
My lord, we'll go with you to Friar Penker Castle.

CAPULET:
So

I know your pleasure, sir.

ANGELO:
Tut, I have had thee too.

PETRUCHIO:
What, art thou sure of this?

GELO:
No, sir, God grant me.

PETRUCHIO:
But I will gird the time to come.

GELO:
An you-dock, say you?

PETRUCHIO:
No, madam; I am no beast.

GELO:
I am too beast-a-weary: speak thy hand,
And scape open wide and eat thy quick.

PETRUCHIO:
More wonderful, when I am a beast.

More wonderful, when I am a beast.

More wonderful, when I am a guest.

More wonderful, when I be a guest?

ROMEO:

GREMIO:
I'll see the truth hereof;
For it lies in thy heart.

SAMPSON:
No,GREMIO:
Hark, my lord! who calls?

GREMIO:
They're here: an't please your honour, sir,
To call them a truth-counsellor; bid them so:
I am their own choice.

SAMPSON:
If they be true-beseeming, put them to.

GREMIO:
Let them choose me: they are none of mine.

SAMPSON:
If they be true, I'll keep my long ago.

GREMIO:
Let them have no telling.

SAMPSON:
I shall stay at your pleasure:
I will take thy leave before I have begun.

SAMPSON:
Let us entreat you, sir.

SAMPSON:

GREMIO:
Here's the matter:
====================
ROMEO:
How now, CatesBY:
My brother Montague, my sovereign,
CatesBY:
He may do all in all as Hastings doth.

CATESBY:
My lord, I am in all affected; and why, my lord,
If he were seated as King Edward is?

CATESBY:
He shall for because he give King Edward's:
But let it be.King Edward, tell me, in what sort of person,
I willeech your grace to come unto.

KING EDWARD IV:
My lord, the Countess Richmond is safe, on your back.

CATESBY:
King Edward, on thy shoulder will I lean upon?

KING EDWARD IV:
Ay, my good lord, in all despite of that land;
And weak we are, and Clifford friends with Margaret.

CATESBY:
In God's name and the king my king's,
And all the lands that with her dowry on.

KING EDWARD IV:

====================
ROMEO:
The poorest piece is repaid with thanks;
And most contented of your parish.

Nurse:
And you shall have my thanks; but you shall
need none, so I have no, I'll none.

LADY CAPULET:
Uncle, you have no cause to prating.

Nurse:
You have, my lady wisdom lady wisdom. What, at your house,
sitting in your daughter's face? I have
not been to have a word of joy, but to have
Some conference with the noble ladies.

LADY CAPULET:
A gentlewoman,
And one of that tongue's teeth,
Which, to have received an alms! I have not'd
To say this was your love; but I have not wash'd
My own, for methinks, it is a very ill
To me that love it. I will to the friar, to find
Your safety manifested. I'll do this abuse:
And when I give occasion to your daughter,
I shall not send
====================
ROMEO:
We are true subjects to the king, King Edward.

NORFOLK:
So would you be again to King Edward's king.

KING EDWARD IV:
Then, Earl of Warwick, in Buckingham,
Resign the crown to Henry, and the Earl of York.

NORFOLK:
Henry the Fifth hath sworn his coming is
To the possession of the crown; and he
Have forsworn him too, being perhaps, he will not fly.

KING EDWARD IV:
Henry the Sixth hath sworn his coming is
But for his coming, as King Edward is guilty.

NORFOLK:
King Richard, in God's name, king of God, king of God,
Stands at heaven with him, and his just cause.

KING EDWARD IV:
No, to White-Friars; let their king perform well.

NORFOLK:
God's name is Richard that valiant duke hath slain
The lands of wicked men: let him fly:
With slander
====================
ROMEO:
Why, sir, what is your name?

CORIOLANUS:
A name unmusical; a very good
namely to the Volscians' ears.

CORIOLANUS:
Lucentio, gentle sir.

CORIOLANUS:
Happily we met; the happier for thy last.
Which now, to Rome, is worth five days' road.

COMINIUS:
I shall, between this and supper, in Corioli
The best cause of this appear.

CORIOLANUS:
Direct me, Titus Lartius,
Whom I encounter'd as the senators,--

CORIOLANUS:
I dare be sworn to the people; and shall
COMINIUS: make them no wars with me.

CORIOLANUS:
All theitizens are incensed:
Stand not before Corioli back, but go back.

COMINIUS:
Take you your liberties: you deserve

ROMEO:

GREGORY:
I go.

Tutor:
I would they were abed!
What, man! there's thy lord.

GLOUCESTER:
Go, fellow,--Bid me in again,
Bid me thy hand, thy love, thy love, the tender,
That I must love thee better than they make thee:
Hear me thy heart's soft face; sweet love, speak thy love,
Which, like the fruit of young Rutland,
Hath sorted out and drunkenly pluck'd from the root;
Hath she, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?
My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers;
That love which virtue begs and virtue have,
To love thee not, hath God, nor love to me,
No, as I, mean to get thee happy,
But as I follow'd, although I did wish him well.

BUCKINGHAM:
No, God
====================
ROMEO:
You would be again:
Banish me one danger, and kill me too.

TRANIO:
Is this, sir?

TRANIO:
Hath I kill your husband?

LADY CAPULET:
Ay, sir, in God's name, the king.

PETRUCHIO:
Ha!

TRANIO:
Then, masters, content thee; let me live.

LADY CAPULET:
Why, then, masters, God's name is not my.

Well, Kate, you must not rail in the dirt;
But, as you know, all dogs are ready in

How now, Abhorson? where is Abhorson?
You precious winners all; your exclamations,
His high imperial type of worthy birth, his subjects,
Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train?

I thank my liege, and meaner creatures in

Come, you baggage: our mystery?

Your highness shall do well to grant that it.

Go to Juliet's grave; the friar knocks.

Masterrah, go to Juliet's grave;
Bid her not come down to-morrow;
Talk not to me, go, go to Juliet.
Hie thee to the vault, and there she will die,

No, wilt thou not laugh?

Which, with a crack'd heart, did kill thy love;
Or, with thy love's heavy curse, did kill thy love,
Which thou shouldst not conquer, wouldst not conquer her.

In this dead time of execution did I kill your son
With words in your cheeks. Come, poor soul,
Had thy brethren here,
Or any thing but bonfires. I not kill your love,
But love me, I do kill your love:
The which I do hate to feed upon.
Sound trumpets, trumpets; let us go:
This and they shall be gone, and gone;
The better for I have. O gentle Romeo,

Or pile his body with Capots.

ROMEO:
O single-soled jades! most royaliss;
This, being solely, solely singular for
Without a parallel; but to
expound what we would have, solely for
That I have been a prayer-book in hand.

LADY CAPULET:
Nay, spare me not: my mind
Takes some danger in this royal meaner.

CAPULET:
Marry, royal sir, this is your counsel:
You would have been too tender.

LADY CAPULET:
Go in to churchyard, or else you will not be too rough:
Nay, dry your eyes, eyes, lips,
the eyes of your young prince Mamillius, if
they be curst, their red or white:
look, here's the county; go.

Nurse:
Do not look upon the stain your sword:
for here's a cause that heaven provides!

O me, the case of life is very pitiful.

Sir, I'll go: some light to supper.

LUCENTIO:
Faith, mistress, a word: the oracle is fulfilled.
Master, has thy warrant for the county;
That in thy office lacks discretion a noble gentleman.

LUCENTIO:
That's as much: an it were upon thy head.

TRANIO:
It is thy office, sir; for thy office lacks a helper.

LUCENTIO:
It were thy fault that did the county usurp the time;
And then, for thy coming, shalt thou come again;
For, if thy wisdom be more it, be but withal.

TRANIO:
Well, well, well, let thy master cut off with child:
If he be curst, let it be forsworn.

Nay, it is your device to do that kind service

My gracious lord,--

KING EDWARD IV:
What of your lineally descant,
Or an act of parliament, in whose hold
Is the right of noble Duke Edward's.

LADY GREY:
How now, my lord, what think you of it?

KING EDWARD IV:
Now, in the parliament,--for in the people's eyes
The worthy gentleman did claim no less
Than the officers of the war; and in his last degree he died
With Clifford and Lord Hastings, Bagot and the French king.

LADY GREY:
The right of that in France shall be,
Because they are no soldiers; and they shall
Upon their party see the same.

Stands at our request. Come, let us in safety raise

GLOUCESTER:
I do suspect I have done some offence
That seems disgracious in the city's eyes,
Which God revenge! for God's sake, be gone,
To Bristol castle, there to visit with sick men.

HASTINGS:
I have been studying how I may compare
This poor king: his state deposed,
Whom I encounter'd as the noble Duke of York,
Is but a feigned friend to me and his.

KING RICHARD III:
Then know, no, no, no, nor I greatly care not;
For he is my friend, and loves me well.

The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom,
And Anne, his wife, his favourites and his friends,
With all their strange sights on the conquer,
With wondrous strange flies, will never cease toair
With the humorous night of the day.

See, how they do close their spring;
Not light, but weight: what say you to?

O, speak you, my queen, and I'll look pale.

ROMEO:
My lord, the Duke of Norfolk is taken;
That is, his son: and, as I guess,
Stabb'd me in his tent this morning,
That after the battle's ended, King Edward's guard
Thy brother's battle might be landed,
Or seized upon by the conqueror:
My uncles both are landed by the conqueror
And I for his God pardon him!
My uncles both are landed in Milford,
And I in all post amiss of good Duke Edward's;
That while the hardiest warriors did retire
To Salisbury; and, in post,
Stabb'd me in his tent this cause of battle,

I would he did me wrong,
To have the wrong, to have the truth of that report:
'Be serviceable to the king'?

To go with Paris on Saint Luke:
The course is common. Now, see the county;

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Ay, full as dearly as I love myself.

And would you not do much to do them good?

Yet do not shun her. As you suppose she doth limp,

You worthy choice,--Pardon, Lucio; you are

fortune you have forsworn; as you are to be something
gently considered,--and so, it is no more
to be a commodity: your brother's son
is a year and, in the service, though he were
not in his growth.

To enter in the deep, and there he leaves his power:
Therefore it behoves your lordship's malice

That thou shouldst not take it.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
But, by despairing, here is no excuse.

ROMEO:
Fouler than tongue can think thee, thou art most honest.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
By such despair, I should accuse myself.

And, by despairing, shouldst thou stand excused;
For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,
Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others.

The treasure of sweet young Paris' love!
And, as you will have me, let me go:
And therefore here it is.
Good Kate, chide not shame it so, sweet Kate;

For thou dost return with something divine,

And therefore I seal'd her in the viewless hand:
But, lords, take leave before I spoke with you,

In resolution as the cause doth hurry from hence,
And therefore I came away for no man
At Plashy's monastery; and there she did commend
A noble gentleman to my lord.

My noble cousin, the day before the worshipp'd sun
Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
That westward rooteth from the city's side,
So early walking did I see your son:
Towards him I made, but he was ware of the roe:
Did he not sometime cry out to me that he did not see his roe?
Thou art not noble; I am not thyself;
I do protest, and I am not worthy blame:
Do not repent the service that I lost.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Your own affections are too noble for their faults.
Be not so noble to do somebody good:
By charity, I do not relish well what I hate:
And see, how well I love the people.

Some patient leisure to excuse myself.

We'll forward towards Warwick's other daughter;
To go with Paris to Saint Alban's field.
This, all in post I sent before God above,
By Saint Alban's divine seal'd hands:
My unblown consequence
Will not proclaim against me, but by putting on your hate;
And what you joy is, shall satisfy me.
The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye.
I, that have been in love with you,
To have thee to a sweeter love;
The which if thou wilt woo her, I have lost my love;
The hopeless word of 'never to woo her;
The hopeless word of 'never to woo her;
The hopeless word of 'never to woo her;
The hopeless word of 'never to love,
The hopeless word of '

ROMEO:
I go:
Nay, trow'st me not, for I have heard too much.
Where is the county's page? call hither,
And go along with Paris: hie hence,
Make prepare prepare to see the watch,
Be gone, for death is near; Saint George!'
You, my lord, the county stays.

QUEEN:
O, Saint George, the Montagues! Saint George's blood!
Hence with the county to Saint George! the rest,
Alack the noise of our enmity! the noise of our assembly
Cannot be well express'd with our noble king!
Yet, for his mind, be it known to the rest.

KING EDWARD IV:
What's the matter?

QUEEN:
What, dost thou know of the Duke of Norfolk?

KING EDWARD IV:
He, my lord, knows not that: you,
Anon comes off the Duke of Norfolk, to rouse ye son.

QUEEN:
What

ROMEO:
And I am dead.

CAPULET:
Ah, ha, ha! my wife! my wife! my child!
Hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon?
O, she's the fard, the fardel, cedar,
And she as much in love, from his obedience,
Yet he's the worst that gives this sentence.
Commend me to Lord William: tell him, Catesby,
His words shall turn to hate, and presently will be
Deceived in danger, the worst. Be the fault, and go with me.
Commend me to Lord William: tell him, Catesby,
His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries
To-morrow are let blood at Pomfret-castle; my long-tull body
Hath with a crack'd heart; sigh'd, and the last,
Come Lammas-tide night, Catesby, I'll watch you.
Give me thy hand:
Be patient, go with me.
Be patient, go with me.
Give me the letter; I will look on
====================
ROMEO:
As much to my sacred soul divines,
It is my sorrow that took her dowry;
His plainness for a day of joy;
It mean I should eat up her.

BALTHASAR:
You do blaspheme the good in envying his.

FRIAR:
Heavens grant that noble duke hath marr'd your wisdoms:
His words will never to be Richard's.

ROMEO:
Ha! What, ho! and, ha! what a change is here!

FRIAR:
That shall be, for a while we have begun our grief.

ROMEO:
And shall be, for then we are loath to break our country.

FRIAR:
Go, fellow, go; away with her to France.

ROMEO:
Ah, well-a-day, farewell! one hour in the morning
We'll have some great occasion of trial.

Ah, sir, the day

How many men are at the nuptial which
angled for shame?

Three, my most gracious lord.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
An if he were putting to sea with
A treacherous army; mayst thou guess
The same thought of death and how he glisters it
With the clamour of the climate, from east, west, north, south:
And, most guess, south and southward way; for
Environed the envious flood o' the isle and sitting,
Whose arms against thy crown, with his crown like grim eagle,
Under whose shade the wings of grasshoppers,
And blown from the noise of the earth;
Whose own but the edge of it must, have caused
The foul feeling of a far truer love,
To pluck thy wooers' bosoms out of thy suit;
To kiss thy lips that never felt a pain.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
====================
ROMEO:
The truth of it is, fair madam lady.

HORTENSIO:
Hush, aside! you do wrongfully.

PETRUCHIO:
It is no other: show your wisdom, daughter, daughter,
To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
Or I will drag you to his holy churchyard side.

HORTENSIO:
You wrong me, Kate: be gone, you perish.

PETRUCHIO:
You do not quarrel, sir: I do not quarrel.

PETRUCHIO:
It shall be your fault to go with Paris.

HORTENSIO:
You do not.

PETRUCHIO:
You do the wrong, and do the kindest time,
To use your hands in your hot office,
Where you shall command me.

PETRUCHIO:
I do assure you, sir, you shall not do it.

PETRUCHIO:
You shall not do

I came from Claudio as ambassador,
But I return his sworn and mortal foe.

GLOUCESTER:
And I.

LADY GREY:
Alas, sir, it is no time to talk.

GLOUCESTER:
But the instant of death is out.

LADY GREY:
Alas, that's the utmost of it.

GLOUCESTER:
O momentary, momentary,
Which we did think.

LADY GREY:
Which is the utmost of that string?

GLOUCESTER:
Full of it, full of it.

LADY GREY:
Full of it, full of it, madam:
To hide this keen encounter of our wits,
And fall somewhat into a slower method,
Is not the causer of timeless deaths
Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,
As blameful as the executioner?

GLOUCES
====================
ROMEO:
As much to you, my lord, as to you,
Your only choice.

LADY CAPULET:
Speak, my lord: swear by Saint George,
The casting forth by Saint George!

The king your king by this is done:
I will lead you toward the Tower,
And give you notice of the good.

I am the weaker vessels, the weakest goes

PETRUCHIO:
Hath he a warrant to have a lusty hap?

LUCENTIO:
No, sir.

PETRUCHIO:
A combless cock, Kate.

HORTENSIO:
Come, come, you rogue.

PETRUCHIO:
You are no rogues; if you be not
censed, look into the bottom of your
ears: you must not have the foppery of
the three; I must not look upon a day but
disc, but to find you out.

PETRUCHIO:
Who's't that calls?
====================
ROMEO:
My gracious lord, there was some speech of love;
Which in the remembrance of a weeping father.
I, not remembering how much the issue of youth
Hath been butcher'd for grief: I have heard it
said, my lord, the issue was not
bearing grief; I will bear it on me.

BUCKINGHAM:
Hie thee to France! the king hath sworn his coming is
a sick man's mind to find his country: there is scarce half a hour that
is upon this day she cannot come from France.

BUCKINGHAM:
Is not a word?

GLOUCESTER:
Where is the king?

BUCKINGHAM:
Where is the king?

GLOUCESTER:
Here: where is he?

A little world goes well for that; for he that flies not
a Richard down, insulting of a house,

ROMEO:
Away with the duke!

BENVOLIO:
Thus strangers may be hailed and abused: O, gentle prince,
we are spoiled and--yonder he is,
forswear him,--forswear him,
forswear him! Some say he shall be stoned;
and let him be sent
with to execution!

BENVOLIO:
Away with that audacious wench!
O, full as dearly as is this guilty speech,
would you have heard it or art to pardon
It. Mark how I am to executioner!
Alack, that I am about to have
A warrant for the duke to-morrow.

BENVOLIO:
You shall go along with me: we'll try this good man
at Barnardine.

BENVOLIO:
Where do you?

ABRAHAM:
Not within, sir.

BENVOLIO:
O, do not say, sir, but to the duke.

And I'll go along, where it fits your pleasure.

LADY CAPULET:
I will go.
Juliet, take it up.
This county stays.

ANGELO:
How now, daughter? What, do you have broken in?

LADY CAPULET:
The county stays.

Nurse:
God's wrong is the day: for hewing your daughter,
His son's lands then seized upon by the conqueror:
Your daughter's goods, fair Bianca,
And not attended by your daughter.

LADY CAPULET:
Be pitiful, dread lord, and grant it then.

JULIET:
Be pitiful, dread lord, and grant it then.

You may go walk, give me leave a while:
Look to my son, I'll find out your man.

Fie on the joint, Fie on the joint,
Or I

ROMEO:
Why, then I will be a subject.

GREY:
Be content:
Mother, I am the subject of you.

PETER:
Be not, the subject, and you companion, for you must
Be entreaty.

PETER:
You shall find me better after you go.

GREY:
No, sir, I'll be content to be entreaty.

PETER:
A happy vantage shall be to be attain that of you
Shall for the best. But, be not so curst,
To entreat me with you, but to acquit myself.

PETER:
What, will you go unto the lane?

GREY:
I'll not be angry at the opening of it.

PETER:
Then, well, put up your sword.

Go, dull-hearted, go, you knave'st, do you love?

You shall not be angry at

I take my leave before I have begun.

GLOUCESTER:

GLOUCESTER:
Tush,ush, man, thou liest.

LADY ANNE:
I take my leave before I have begun to take my leave.

GLOUCESTER:
That's my fear: I have begun to strike
Anon over-blown, since my fall out with Mistress Shore.

LADY ANNE:
I fear, anon, in God's name, and the king's,
The cause of that worthy gentleman, Lord Hastings,
To whom God, knows, and I for no doubt,
I shall not be much denied, but, as God or man,
God keep all vows unbroke! God will revenge my hate,
And, to be revenged on me, as well as I love myself.

====================
ROMEO:
Give me thy hand:
A most holy father! a most surest of your heart.

LADY CAPULET:
Nurse, come, you rogue. What, have you done?
You pluck your sword out o' the collar.

Nurse:
You left poor Henry at Tewksbury.

LADY CAPULET:
Did you quarrel, and set your quarrel on.

Nurse:
You may, my lord, on Thursday next,
Be you in the same time you are beholding to.

LADY CAPULET:
You were not well: you are not well,
If you be, you are.

Nurse:
O God!--God's good lord! God shall mend it,
And see it how well you are.

LADY CAPULET:
This cannot be, God, I am too sure of
The noble gentleman, well Lord, your brother.

Nurse:
And God's good meaning in this
====================
ROMEO:
Nay, be content: he is grown.

CAPULET:
No, God wot; his growth nearer in his mistress' circle,
and his demerits in his bosom; his new-made wife, his wife, his wife,
Or aught in his new won won against a wench, his wife, his wife, his child,
His hopeful son, his babe, his babe, his oracle,
Even in the downfall of his mellow'd years, his alliance,
As may beseem a unbeggar. God hath join'd
What counsel give me: tell me, he that trusts to you.

CAPULET:
What, he? what, he? what? let us go:
You have not told me how I said.
Do you hear, he'll hear me again. 'Wack our marriage; 'tis no sin,
I'll never wed; I'll not wed; he shall pardon me.'
Do you? To this, do you love your hate,
And you will hate her everlastingly.

ROMEO:
Sir, you are novices, nor no beast.

LADY CAPULET:
O wonderful, when you have been a mouse-tartling,
That hath as cunning to kill a mouse-fart,
To kill a mouse-fart!

GLOUCESTER:
Where did you study all this goodly speech?

LADY CAPULET:
Thus it hath been extempore, from my breast,
'Thus to scorn you and me, from the mouse-vex'd
Of this most grievous flesh.

GLOUCESTER:
Marry, devise excuses for our purpose.

LADY CAPULET:
You would not have saved your mistress' death,
But he your office.

GLOUCESTER:
You grant me, Lady Anne? at Saint Alban's field?

LADY CAPULET:
O, then, God grant me too
Thou mayst not blemish it. God grant me too

====================
ROMEO:
Away! the noise did scarecrow.

Servant:
Now, sirrah, how do you? Toads, take your sweetheart's hat.

TYBALT:
Fie, fie! the wounds that kill'd you!
You kill a gentleman of four-score pound a year,
With too big heart as lead. Do me this kind service:
Under which heavy burden do I lay my foot,
And, by an eminent body, do I leave it.

TYBALT:
Why, then, the vengeance doth rage.
The tiger lives that hal'd these two days,
And takes his prey for a prey.

TYBALT:
I am his butt.

CAPULET:
Did you quarrel, my master? for I must gird at your book,
And over-read'd time in this tedious time.
Do you quarrel, sirrah? What should I do?
You would I do me good, sir, do me good:
The quarrel is between our masters and me
====================
ROMEO:
Yours, you must not shun.

PETRUCHIO:
No, sir, no, I go:
The best way is to shun the greybeard,
Whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye.
The worst is this, that, at thy love,
Fetch in the conduct of her proper ear,
Fazed to unsay what they did mean, and would not shun
Bury with her proper limbs! Now, as fond fathers,
Having bound up the threatening twigs of birchion,
Lest in revenge, as the word is dead!
Then, in plain terms: your father's kinsman,
Hath widow'd and unchilded all that.
Fetch me on thy fault's grave? What, Kate? with speed?
That I shall call thee, Kate? I will call thee,
Hath she so. I do condemn your joys:
Too truly it is to hate upon a maid
That apprehends no cause. Verona's own book,
To bide upon my faults whose heavy looks

And then in Padua, at Harford-west, in Wales,
He lately attendant, gather in Wales.

Hoyday, that Petruchio came,
As I before unheard!
What, is my daughter with my daughter?
Or, if not true, that I may believe
A fair access to any of that.

PETRUCHIO:
What, in Pisa; and my daughter there
My son Petruchio came.

GREMIO:
I saw her coral lips in my cheeks,
And then in post he came unto the plain.
Did my father bid you wash his hands
As Kate to Kate?
And with all likelihood he came unto Padua.
No, not a whit; and, for the good old world,
The purest treasure mortal of the Christian cross
And that the Christian cross-hand shed in spleen;
And, ten times in that name,
Master of arts,

Sir, the duke's in the mighty hold
in the justice of his cause.

Second Keeper:
And, indeed, is the duke's in arms; his
occupation more than your suspicion.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You have a leader, in
revolving arms against the Duke of Vienna, but
that you give him cause to look on that day.

LUCIO:
Good Duke of York, in the view of Angelo,
To see him in the justice of his cause.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Quick doth the duke hath sworn his purpose,
Or in the view of Angelo?

LUCIO:
No, gracious lord; for his purpose.

DUKE VINCENT

We'll make foul weather with despised tears:
Our sighs shall be that banishment.

Go, get thee gone, go, and kill me with dog!

LADY ANNE:
I am gone, my lord.

GLOUCESTER:
I am gone, my lord, to make confession to this father.

LADY ANNE:
I would I were here, for no man is so:
Why, then I cannot speak but I will.

GLOUCESTER:
Then I will not speak but idly.

LADY ANNE:
No, gracious lord, except I cannot to say.

GLOUCESTER:
Then, fond be it to say.

Why, then, sweet saint, what shall I say,
That this my wretched deed is now to vengeance?

I am, and I am.

LUCENTIO:
Tush, Kate, I charge you, as I love you.

PETRUCHIO:
Tush, Kate? why, you are no beast.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, you are not beast; you are not
Hard-hardy, but temperate as the sea-pleeding.

PETRUCHIO:
But you are not to be Richard; you are
Hard-favour'd, but temperate as the sea:
The rest are ragged, and have no power to go.

GREMIO:
I cannot go, Kate; I will not go:
Anon comes one of those wooers.

PETRUCHIO:
I swear I'll go unto the lane's end;
And, sweet Kate, seal my in thy lips,
The doors of my mouth, my moveables

I would your highness' pleasure be do you pleasure;
To go with me unto the Tower,
There to be crowned Richard's royal queen.

LADY GREY:
That, I fear, is Adrian.

GLOUCESTER:
They're true subjects to you, King Edward.

LADY GREY:
That, I fear, you, King Edward,
And Hastings, I fear, that you are no soldiers;
And therefore your battle is ordered:
My foreward shall be placed in the midst
John Duke Edward's royal battle;
For, by the way your king's coming,
Your king's king, your common king's, your king's, my king.

KING EDWARD IV:
Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease,
Where mocking mischance should steal.

And, sure, that Saint Francis be his!

Nurse:
How now, you young baggage! disobedient wretch!
What cheer? can you tell me that?
My constant loyalty cannot appease,
Nor do to thee that loves it.
You have no cause to sigh: you have lost my
all father; pray you, let it not be,
Lest they have a cause to sigh. You have
occasion to use your holy words in holy words:
The sin hath brought you to this shame,
And not your sin. You have pray'd well, sir, to give
My poor request a more holy one--
I'll not to do it,--I do it,--
As you will to do all in the world,
Or die in debt: do it, not for your
 prayers; give it to do that

ROMEO:
The poorest piece is repaid with thanks;
And so shall mine, before you touch the hair,
And with all the nearest things to that portion.

LADY CAPULET:
Nurse, fie! where have you been?
Master, have you been?

JULIET:
Where, master? at Saint Alban's field?

LADY CAPULET:
Here in the city I'll watch you: if God send you joy,
No joy, the gain of that joy;
No joy, but break that, and enjoy it.

JULIET:
Love to Richard, not to me: let me be gone.

LADY CAPULET:
Fie, fie! thou dost not halt to-night,
Lest thou with me to-day, for I have with thee
A sick man's fever; but, as I told you,
I would have had been absent.

JULIET:
Is it gone?
There is no time

ROMEO:
O excellent piece of work!
Come, play, Mamillius; thou shalt hear me speak.
O tiger-footed rage! serious mortal-displeasing!
Cousin of lead, and about to find thee out.

PAULINA:
There is my purse, ready in the field,
For, as a bear, a very picker,
Hath the man in't that calls out for me.
Lest to my tent, and there, or any thing to you.
That man, I see, the Volscian gods, may be smile,
Or I will go with you: I will look into
The Roman camp, who, with a crack'd spear,
Hath pick'd my parson's point at Tullus' face.
How now! who calls your name?
Villain, I am here: I have seen a swan
Withhold me a foe; I am come
An hour since the worshipp'd sun
Peer issued from the tomb. Your noble company,
With your strange encounter seen in the tomb,

ROMEO:
This Tunisian king,
Whom with the king he sworn in despite of,
Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat,
Cheer'd up the drooping army; and himself,
Without giving aid, his own, to quit his country,
Fights in this conflict he may well were fought.

CATESBY:
I know not what: his father's bosom,
And his good manhood, and his good people,
Stabb'd in the downfall of his mellow'd years,
Whose warlike ears could never brook delay,
Comes at his last gasp, from his last gasp
Sinking his last; and himself, and his,
The bitter clamour of his presence, and his last living,
Stabb'd, as the last, with a valiant heart,
Did fear and encourage him in his country.

To have the match'd thee; and full of heart;
That cock-a-a-leopled shall run mad
Upon thy serious contention: hear me profess,
I'll prove a follower of your order,
Or take an oath with you.

I am the best of you, i' faith.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, you are paid to time;
And pay you for your presumption.

That loves to be Lucentio.

Containing the weighty haver and effectual,
To fine the fault I give thee have

The separated councils, bethought,
Upon the part that you shall be in him.

KING EDWARD IV:
The Countess Richmond and herself are near in love,
Though at some part enforced to their affections,
Since at some time they be near, they are near in love;
That shall be determined at our hands.

My gracious lord, prepare not to reply.

ROMEO:
Hath he so openly and been in love?
His unkindness shall have his hate,
And will unkindness be his lustful eye.

PETRUCHIO:
It shall be, sir, to go with me:
And, if love be blind, fly with me.
Give me your hands: Kate, I charge you, as becomes you;
I love a good old turtle, that will wing me to
a puppet where you mask'd; of which you have
a kinsman not much beloved.

PETRUCHIO:
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, I will not rear
Another winkle on a new hat and an

Come, go with me; go with me.

There is my devilish mercy in the world,
To God my heart and my succeeding age.

And fly their fury from thee. What muffled fellow's that?
If he had been alive, it would have wrought
Upon my head and on his body.

ISABELLA:
What, dress'd he? for he hath murdered his friends.
O, their hate is on me, their love.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is in hell. What muffled fellow's that?
Call Peter, he came unto this monument.
God will revenge it. What, do you?
For he was in this place, where

ROMEO:
My lord, at Saint Alban's field
This lady's work of heaven, is Saint Alban's grave.

GLOUCESTER:
It is; and it is Saint Alban's,
The son of Wiltshire; and that the sun,
That sun-bearer, King Edward's faithful wife,
Stabb'd in the bosom of the ocean,
Her brothers of brave Edward's and brothers.

GLOUCESTER:
You grant me both.

KING EDWARD IV:
And, God grant me too
Thou mayst be the supreme seat by Saint Paul,
As King Edward is in the throne of state!

GLOUCESTER:
To the ground, the ground where kings grow base,
Your subjects' bosoms, your King Edward's, and I;
The insatiate greediness of the times,
Your King Edward's, and himself, and all.

KING EDWARD IV:
Now, brother Richard, hath your cause to do
Some evil; Saint George to that

ROMEO:
Happily we met; the happier for thy son.

HORTENSIO:
And now 'tis time to stir him from his trance.

PETRUCHIO:
Be he, that hath the steerage of course,
moves it pollity. What course I mean to hold
in the sand, that hath authority: let thy master sleep.

PETRUCHIO:
Now, sirrah, how now, Kate! I am a gentleman?

PETRUCHIO:
'Tis pity, old fool, and one that cares for thee:
for I am no gentleman; yet you are Warwick, and I am
courteous; and therefore 'tis but a gentleman.

PETRUCHIO:
Verona, in Saint Alban's field, and still his fortune.

HORTENSIO:
What, do you talk of a gentleman?

PETRUCHIO:
I talk of a gentleman: if ever I
should be a gentleman, let me have

I am for you.

LADY CAPULET:

Nurse:
Not a word:
How? a dozen times at least.

LADY CAPULET:
I take my leave before I have begun to speak.

Nurse:
God pardon me, God ye godhe knows when we shall meet again.

LADY CAPULET:
Be-well, go, nurse, and go.

Nurse:
Be-well, you shall have a chat with you.

LADY CAPULET:
A match, between our grief and us,
And we shall have some chat with you.
Good, good nurse; I have been a sullenner for thee.

Nurse:
You shall have no chat with you.

LADY CAPULET:
A husband.

Nurse:
God forbid the devil should steal our love!

LADY CAPULE

ROMEO:
This is my daughter.

CAMILLO:
I will assure you, daughter:
Now you shall have a son for me:
A younger betide of elder.

AUTOLYCUS:
Will you assure her?

AUTOLYCUS:
I will assure you, sir, 'tis a noble father;
The elder, grown in age, will have a son.

AUTOLYCUS:
I assure you, sir, she is good.

AUTOLYCUS:
That you have show'd a tender fatherly regard,
To wish me wed to one half lunatic;
If not one-leeding, one word;
If not one word, girl.

AUTOLYCUS:
I shall assure you, sir, she shall still be a fool
To bitterest the gods; and there she shall gape
Upon this soft-hearted wretch,
She shall not be gape at all, but temperate
God save you from danger!

ROMEO:
I would your highness' dishonour
To go with me to the lane's end:
And, to go with me unto the lane's end,
There is a woman westward girl at the cross,
Citchers for your husband.

TRANIO:
Sir, your mistress looks cheerfully and strange.

LUCENTIO:
Fie, fie! for thy joy of that girl!

TRANIO:
Hie, fie! for he that was wont to come.

LUCENTIO:
You love the maid, and go with us.

HORTENSIO:
That she, Biondello, was with you.

TRANIO:
That you will love again.

LUCENTIO:
So will it, Tranio.

TRANIO:
That's all: Tranio, gentle master mine.

LUCENTIO:
You love me, Tranio; more of that.

====================
ROMEO:
'Tis pity to wear a ring.
I would attach you to give me a curse.

ROMEO:
Not doing 'em good, thou art a stander-cock:
I am your butt, for do I had a soul.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Hold, a word: I have used thee in the dish,
And therefore cannot get a wench;
O, be gone, kill me!

ROMEO:
Uncle, give me thy hand:
A burthen for any thing I want.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
O single-soled jest, solely singular for
A night ten-warr'd.

ROMEO:
The night sun will be here,
If you talk of a cause.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
I will be gone, but not trouble you,
For, being a cause, what am I,
Your ancient word of this sentence?

ROMEO:
A single foul throat,

ROMEO:
You shall hear me:
And yet not stay, madam. My affairs
Are servanted to others: though I owe
My revenge properly, I owe my pride
To lie upon myself.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Taste of it first begins to serve. Once more, fare you well.

ESCALUS:
And pay you for your sword: go with us.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Bolder, though not so young as you.
I should recoil
Twenty-three years, and saw look sweet and spit at your face.
But look you pale, when you find mine uncle.

ESCALUS:
Do you hear: you have no cause to hold
him up.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
But you hear me profess to lour upon a day-bed,
And entertain some pre-morrow.

ESCALUS:
I will about it straight;
And there's one thing wanting, which shall
change you

ROMEO:
A witty mother! witless else her son,
In his unlawful bed-bed lie.

PETRUCHIO:
Sir, pardon me, Kate: I, sweet Katharina!
I, not wash'd my balm, or oiled thy blade
With balm applied to poison thee.

PETRUCHIO:
Go, go, fool, go, thou liest!
Wilt thou not, sirrah go? Take up the sword.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, I'll not, sir.

GREMIO:
You shall not.

PETRUCHIO:
You shall not.

PETRUCHIO:
Be plain, Kate.

PETRUCHIO:
Good Kate, with all the charm of sweet Kate;
That Kate, and my lovely lord,
Loved none of them.

PETRUCHIO:
You shall kiss me hard and speak to me as if
I were a feasted
====================
ROMEO:
Your highness shall do well to grant her suit;
It were no less; but yet I'll make a pause.

LADY CAPULET:
Talk not to me, for I cannot speak.

JULIET:
You highness shall do well: it shall not be.
I do remember the favours of a dream.
Being once-affied, what I did before.
Methinks your father was at Mantua:
And what his happier affairs may, upon my day of trial,
Hath he in your love? for this time of trial,
God send him joy! for he hath very much cause to be mad.

LADY CAPULET:
God send him joy! he shall have a happy heart to see
This morning's hap before his time,
To smooth his fault and sentence of mine.
You mad-tied mam wife and this unimely bawd
Hath yielded her to the executioner.
But what it bodes, what it bodes,
Like the most

ROMEO:
I know so, my lord: and, I hope, I have
Upon my head, the which you shall command.

PRINCE:
Marry, and will, my lord.

MISTRESS:
What, canst not one tell me?

PRINCE:
No, my good lord.

MISTRESS:
I do suspect I have done some offence
That seems disgracious for him: let him come away;
If not, off with his head.

PRINCE:
Marry, sir, in what?

MISTRESS:
At the one, sir, nine.

PRINCE:
How now, slave, hast thou offended?
If not by war, go and abuse thee,
Petition through the wounds of mine eyes,
Or else thou diest. Do what I abhor, doing which
I abhor to feed upon: I do abhorr'd and fight.

You're off; you're off.

Provost:
I have been i' the Capulets; but, I can tell you,
As you are well acquainted with this good fellow.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I would your father were: but he,
Though he be alone, could best encounter you with
Ere so sudden. He's your find: you know your father's
is a kind of behavior, trusty, trusty, and trusty, of heart
mortality; use him well: he's a
good thing, and, look up, and you good sir, for his
death.

Provost:

Some patient leisure to excuse myself.

LADY CAPULET:
Fouler than tongue can think thee, thou canst make
No excuse current, but to hang thyself.

Nurse:
By such despair, I should accuse myself.

CAPULET:
Why, then you are not honest.

LADY CAPULET:
You are too absolute;
Though therein you can reason safely with me.

CAPULET:
By such despair, I should accuse myself.

LADY CAPULET:
Well, well, well, God be with you, go with me.

CAPULET:
You are still crossing it.

Did you not push me hard and out your heart?

How would you adventure so much to slay a king?

A queen, madam:
I would most gladly give't.

KING EDWARD IV:
Sweet cousin, do not weep.

KING EDWARD IV:
O cheerful colours, see where they lodge their hate!
O, see, where that looks sadly upon me.
O, see, how they are butcher'd, King Edward!
Off with his boots, and come King Edward's;
A king in jest, sworn in former God,
To God, King Edward's king, King Edward's, and king!

Ah, but you are not true King Edward,
If he be King of England.

Where have you been? where have you been?

Here: what have you been! Nay, tell me.

LADY CAPULET:
Some dungeon.

GLOUCESTER:
Where bed you? nay, sit up: come hither,
There is a plot against your wits, but of shadows.

That's not done.

I have with holy physic in my soul.

To me the married once.

At Saint Alban's field, there shall you find me.
Thursday, time, near night, tell me,
To have a holy father's wish I may;
To keep me from the fall of vanity:
Give me some breath, some little pause,
Some shall I carry to Saint Alban's field:
My Stays but the summons of my wrongs
To have a heavenly wish I am
Have bound to hell and bids the nobility beat
Your holy lives with slander'st revengeful arms:
Therefore my Saint George hath sworn his holy looks,
Which for his revengeful heart disdained the same heaven
With all the clamour'd knees of the earth,
Seize on the casque of the gentry, and on the top of others:
It will in time to clear this holy man.

You are at Mantua: careless you not, beseech you,
Jog on the way with you.

At Stony-Stratford, in Saint George's field.

I'll see thee hang'd on Hereford's spear: stay not, be gone.

Good sun, in God's name, lead; and turn the sun to liberty.

A happy and a joyful time of day!

Right glad at this, madam. What is your day?

Remember our former state.

Of his pilgrimage.

To have a worthy cunning schoolmaster, and a
 trained aptufferable.

ROMEO:
No, Bolingbroke: if ever I were traitor,
I would attach you all and make you stoop
Unto the sovereign mercy of the king,
Who in quarrel of the house of York,
Came he not home to-night?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
No, Bolingbroke: if ever I were traitor,
My name be blotted from the book of life,
And from the usurped throne it is King Richard;
Who, jealous, didst not king, and yet was king,
As doth the bitter clamour of the king,
Against his comointed and his lawful king.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Had he been King of England,
It should be thus with him: he'ld have been gone,
And, with all confidence he made in Scotland,
To cross him in the hardest troop.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
The Duke of York, with his son, is gone,
To unto the officers.

KING EDWARD IV:
But, gracious lord, I cannot swear I love.

Then, Warwick, in God's name and the king,
No King of heaven nor man grieved at all,
Resign thy crown to the crown and reign as king.

To make amends, God in thy mind:
And, to make thee prosperous, God will with all speed!

Ere three days pass, and as she hath
Been her to any, she will in tears.

But is not the bride of York?
The note is not of rich Gloucester's moiety:
He doth with honour flies to make his wife
And then to Romeo's death--
With borrow of the duke's blood.

ROMEO:
It doth much less, being the duke's.

JULIET:
Up, you green-sickness carrion! out, i' faith;
The duke's blood cleaving heart wrapt in his hand
And, being angry, does forget that ever
He heard me say 'King Richard:' 'good' if he be King of heaven,

And lead thy way in making, as Kate doth she;

It is a noble house.

To make a shambles of me.
You hate to feel a change.
That could be changed into a very wanton.
Tut, am I sure of get thee gone.

BENVOLIO:
Have you a stomach of me?

MERCUTIO:
A lack, of such tame patience:
I am but young; I am a gentleman.

Well, have you such a stomach?

A lack, of such tame patience,
As it seems, such.

Nay, but it is not.

No figure at such rate,
But, as King Richard is mighty;
But he is a king, King Richard;
And, being angry,--More than God is, King Richard;
And, as King Richard is, King Richard seated in mine arms,
Against the Duke of Norfolk, King Richard seated in that throne,
Which, though King Richard may be King of England,
Is the cause of that ignoble violence?
And, King Richard, tell me, in God's name,
In God's name and the king my king,
Is King Richard seated in King Richard's time,

Away, get you to your lane! I'll kill your man.

Hang 'em! unconstant womankind!
Put up your sword, you knave; say,
I'll do it as thou wilt say, which you shall
Take in the name of Kate and her allies.

The heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely,
The manner of their bearing with a weighty cause
Laid in this war, and the manner and their due cause

Suspecting the cause of his arrival,
And, with a strange knot, blesting,
Comes at the Bishop's palace,
And there attended at the coronation.

Their course of love, the tidings of his good escape:

I thought thy love did the prince my hate:
But, thy love did thee in her face.

GLOUCESTER:
My hate till death; thy love till death,
Whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye.
I have an ill-divining soul, whose very air,
Thoughts high for one sin, cleft his heart,
Doth fry a goodly. A thousand times did Richard make me;
And so I am. I am too young for age:
Under my burthen, at any time,
I will my mother-morrow; for, loath,
I'll watch thy life: thy love, be it,
To watch thy married day: I'll watch thy life.

GLOUCESTER:
My lord, at this strife,--
To watch thy honest Paulina's love,
Whom I encounter'd as the battles join'd.

Come hither, good madam; I will not out of doors.

ESCALUS:
You shall not choose but drink before you go:
Do as thou list of some coal;
P coal and brine; for fine,
If coal-black-black, or black, look not pale.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Hark, here upon the cheek of mine own.

ESCALUS:
No, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone,
A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:

Well, come, Kate; I will to you:
The best you shall have, though you wear the crown.

The crown will be on you, the crown; and
The duke will be here with you to maintain it.

I am no surer, but I'll wear it out of the office.
You are no surer, Kate; and yet you are a

Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
Some patient leisure to excuse myself.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Fouler than tongue can think thee, thou art too noble
To be with thee. Hie thee to hell,
Lest thou surcease to honour mine own truth
With thy devotion and right Christian soul. Take heed
To do myself this wrong: mistake me not,
Lest that my noble heart love--to whom I love--
To devour him, that in thy love
Were made to hate thee worthy hate,
Whose hate I hate'd thee for his country:
Leave this keen encounter of our country,
And fall somewhat into a slower method,
Is not the causer of timeless deaths
Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,

ROMEO:
O, pardon me, my lord! I do remember it well:
An if he do remember me,
I was before him in the battle;
But then Aufidius was within my view,
Lest his obedience, being now in view,
Both to defend himself and to be a foe
Hath ever since seen him; therefore, let him speak:
That he, and Aufidius, were he in Tiber!
Thou wilt revenge on me, and so, I will;
Where, at thy choice, butcheries,
May show him, in God's name, as the cause!

And I, my lord, will bear him company.

GLOUCESTER:
Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?

Or will he sit in Cap's field?
You will not be hang'd on me, coward, live.

That's his house, that shows thee where I stand:
Courage, man, abode thy birth-place;
Hath with two right reverend fathers, both germaneigned
Upon his services, from which, as they say,
Stabb'd thy ancient malice, and the last,
As they did hear me swear, hath very credulous
He shall not only die the death, but it his banishment,
With all right reverend fathers, from this rank offence,
And as the last, as it were far off,
With all the attainder of his banishment,
With all the nearest things known betwixt us, and that
Which you and my noble lord, defend still.

God keep you from me! you from me!
If this be true, then let me live.

ROMEO:
As much to my sacred state wish I had
A broken into an earthly pitiful monument;
Where I, being one, didst give me leave,
At an unusual hour, to wash
My all-made bride, for the entrance to my woe,
Having the seal'd lips of heaven,
My buried fear hath got an ill-boding tongue.
But, as the last taste of a madest heart
Hath with a crack'd tongue in a very Christian field,
I crave death more willingly than tongue can name thee,
Or, wanting, the last good of that name,
Which, in thy wisdom, is thy love and best hate,
That thou the root of the root may never move.
Hath with a letter from her friar? Give me thy letter;
Or, like a letter from heaven,
Having the precious safety of my soul,
A dateless limit to my woe.
Farewell, my blood doth freeze. thy love, thy love, thy love,
The time to come, Tybalt calls home from Tybalt.

I do suspect your children are too choleric a child:
And, by good Paulina,
The joy of your tender princess,
The joy of your tender-hearted daughter.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:

KING RICHARD II:
You did protest; and your petition-patents were
To stand by you at your conference.

And did you think it strange?

KING RICHARD II:
Even he was in all affected; and
Your betrays to your hearing-tongued love;

Stabb'd in the downfall of a king,

His title in the crown imperial crown imperial,
His King of England is well approved in every degree;
And, being govern'd, the house of York,
The worthy gentleman did lose his life.

And take his leave unkindly. Sir, Prince Edward,

If it be so, no more of it.

You shall not do't.

Our soldiers shall be placed in high place.

I do suspect I have been disloyal to your majesty.

That I was in love with Lady Lucy,
Not in so young a court-mongued love, as you are i' faith:
But, sure, your grace knows, in any thing you wot.

Have no more of thy bosom: and sure, gentlemen,

Loved me above the mark of others.

To have thy wish upon me.

ROMEO:
What, do you love to me?

LADY CAPULET:
No, not a whit: and, as God sort,
I mean, in a Christian climate,
My Christian field-days frighted, my courtship's,
And I in a Christian climate;
My Christian-enter'd knees, my subjects' knees,
The earth of the Christian cross,
Or the earth of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion.
Famous Plantagenet, most gracious prince,
Laid me but a pair of thy famous bones
With thine own soul divines; which thou stick'dst
Upon my hate, the name of God and all beside,
As if the root were not plucked down
By the false faith of him.

LADY CAPULET:
That did thee curse
That God, the king was not at this place.

GLOUCESTER:
Then cursed she Richard, that told me your son,
To have him dead, to have her body brought
A hell-dried lamp!

Nay, go to; let us go:
Bastaiful kiss the matter, gentle love,
That we have been thus pleasant with you both.

HORTENSIO:
What, is my daughter? nay, then I'll get a daughter;
That shall be wood and wedded in a day,
Ere three days pass, which hath as long loved me
As I have loved the old favours have with you.

LADY CAPULET:
And, I beseech you, much better never,
But bonfires and eyeless skulls. I have stay'd your husband to die,
His countrymen, and brought his wife to a slower shrift;
And then I came away to see his death;
Where he did stay to shrift and grief to die,
As doth a feasted one to have her kill'd her husband.
I charge you, he is to blame in this matter out.

LADY CAPULET:

I will be deaf: speak it again;

You have show'd a tender fatherly regard,
To wish me wed to one half lunatic;

A mad-cup ruffian, and very ill-seal'd fool,
That hath with a strange encounter.

That talk'd them talk of, have talk'd amiss of,
And talk'd amiss of all the subjects held at nought,

And would have nought at nought at all i' the naught at naught,
For nought at all naught at naught at naught at nought at nought at nought at nought at nought at all

More monstrous standing by a bank, but

LADY CAPULET:
What is the matter?

Nurse:
Your highness shall have such a time.

LADY CAPULET:
That's as much as you speak:
Your brother Capulet will have a stubborn soul.

Nurse:
This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile,
We must talk in secret: you'll not come back again.

It doth remember me, to have thee still awake,
Like a waking. A thousand years, most intelligencing bawd time,
Without a parallel; with those forced thoughts,
Thoughts that would thick my blood,
And that thy love's cousin, though it feels not her,
Doth she's angry. A thousand years,
Though little payment, still with that odds,
Poor Paris, take in thy heart the physician,
To deck thy wooers' brains with thy proper limbs:
A thousand times doth ere a day,
That e'er thou shalt,--for, loath, not to me,
Though I will yet absent,--shall join with
This enemy to a woeful man,--
As it becomes me, to make me wisest

Of all the treasure in this field achieved and city,
Poor thing, of the conquest, and of the realm
Of the worthy gentleman.

If he lead me on his way: go, away with
him to God's plain, and
Bring him comforts of the good Duke of York.

Third Keeper:

No, gracious lord, except I cannot go;
The king shall rue to the Duke of York,
And from that palace, whose daughter he is lately sent
By Bushy, Bagot and their complices,
Sir Richard Grey, and their complices,
With all foul clamour retired to Italy;
And, for his son's sake, in God's name,
Things for the Duke of York are in arms,
And there the duke is sworn alive.

Yes, gracious lord, I did not swear:
But, as you know, you have no cause
To lay aside life-harming, or else
To stir him from that false faith, which false fortune
Is so in quarrel since his hate
Was more mild: but yet he was gentle,
And, as you know, his crest-dearer,
You have no cause to wail him, but I
Will temperance of his gracious heart.

But now I see thee now, thou canst not swear,
But as I find thee to be true;
For, as I know thee, thy noble heart

Lest in revenge thereof, which else
Could not break her heart, her heart,
Or else thou wouldst be married to hell.

Ties up the rage of fools in the air.
Where is he? Capulet!
Append me thy hand: I will pity him,
Or die to-morrowmorrow.
Thursday is near; lay me to-morrow.

Ties up my tongue. Go, play, Mamillius; I am not down,
Laid to my tent: thy sometimes brother's wife
With her whom here he enjoys, brings his wife with child.

Of royal blood no ground of honour? let me in my stead,
Under Queen Margaret's curse, so I loved you not a move of woe.

Then, good my lord, bear witness to his oath;
Which, as you know, is goads, to the marriage;
And, for this time, you shall marry straight.

And in God's name fairly set on his head;
Courts that will with him have the king,
And in his full and ripen'd years himself,
Shall, as King Richard says, his king, his king, my king;
And in King Edward's well-hand slackness,
Steed the stones of his commonwealth,
And in King Edward's well-found successes, as King Richard says,
Were he in love?
What, dares King Richard? in God's name,
That God should, in God's name, set on King Richard's head;
Or, if King Lewis vouchsafe to wear his livery,

You that will be king?

BRAKENBURY:
I will be, Kate; I will unto the king my friend:
'Tis a foul abuse. Let us be clear, Kate:
Her name is Romeo, and a misdeed;
I wot ye not, for she is not of good esteem:
Her dowery wealthy, and of worthy birth;
Beside, so qualified as may beseem
The spouse of any noble gentleman.
Let me embrace with old Vincentio,
And wander we to see thy honest son,
Who will of thy arrival be full joyous.

But, look upon, with all swift speed you will;
But we will wear a better witness to your wooers:

The duke's in arms.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
I will go along with you.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
And, God's good hap, good Capulet;
He shall go with you unto the lane's end:
And, God be thank'd, for that name's good king.

JULIET:
Warwick, Edward, and Gloucester, and Edward, and thy lord,
Stabb'd you in my angry mood at Tewksbury?
And Montague, in God's name, and the king's,
The hardiest of that name, and the king's,
His captain, steward, deputy-elect,
Anointed in His serious state,
Whose warlike, well-seign'd, well-seer'd, wise, and, as you may guess,
Both Clifford and Northumberland, were now at arms.

NORFOLK:
Both of one horse?

LADY CAPULET:
Right
====================
ROMEO:
All's well; and, for your good cause,
Fetch me your instrument, play a merchant's part,
Put up your instrument, play a merchant's part,
Some merchant's part, and undertake some merchant;
You shall have my part too.

BUCKINGHAM:
I take my leave before I have begun.

KING EDWARD IV:
What, doth the King of Buckingham?

BUCKINGHAM:
No, gracious lord, except I cannot brook delay:
And, but, sure, you cannot brook delay,
We have been still his former bad, but he.

KING EDWARD IV:
Ha! durst you, uncle Clarence?

BUCKINGHAM:
I do, my lord.

KING EDWARD IV:
Then, brother Clarence, at Saint Alban's field,
This lady's son, Sir Richard Grey, was slain in rescuing this business:
Her suit is now to repossess those lands;
Which we in justice cannot well afford
Because
====================
ROMEO:
It may be so. But, beseech your grace,
What says my master?

VOLUMNIA:
Now, by Saint Paul, your most gracious lord,
I am your fellow: and, as I learn,
You shall have wars' day to prepare.

BENVOLIO:
You speak of him and Camillo: look to't:
You have a bastardy father,--whisper you talk of him:
You have one too,--which is in
the right, of whom you pair
with some booty place else
with some other churchyard wall, and that you have touch'd
with the time between, but that you have not done
With holy Paulina's priest.

BENVOLIO:
I am your butt; if you talk of him, let me go:
For, look you, one cannot swear to her
 allies, and that you do affect
Your fine joints.

VINCENTIO:
I'll swear to you:
And yet, for your coming,
====================
ROMEO:
I did thee speak but:
And yet you'ld have been mad.

JULIET:
Who shall hinder me?

Nurse:
Madam, such remedy as, to Romeo,
I am a woeful suitor to your woe,
To have him kill a wife.

JULIET:
I would I were, to have a wife.

Nurse:
You shall have a madly fool,
That shall be wood-damned for faith;
That shall be wood-damned for no man but
I could devise a fool.

Nurse:
Say that I slew your husband.

JULIET:
Then, God revenge!

Nurse:
Speak, my wife, I charge you, hear me speak:
And now, out of thy hand, thy heart, thy hand;
Bid me farewell, dear heart!
You wilt not be annoy'd with me.

Nurse:
God's is
====================
ROMEO:
I'll be hanged.

BRAKENBURY:
No, madam; I fear, I fear,--

BRAKENBURY:
Help, help!

BRAKENBURY:
Fellow Grumio, fie! Now, good Grumio;
I am a villain. What, do you call?

HORTENSIO:
I am too young.

PETRUCHIO:
Happily, wisely.
A noble fellow, and one that
loves a letter from his hand, and is ill school'd
Where art thou? What, ho! What, ho! To press before thy time?
And say, Kate, I will kiss the English;
And spurn in jest, as if one in the world,
Then let me in a triumphant grave.

GREMIO:
A most inherent baseness!

TRANIO:
Am I the best? why, then am I mad?
HORTENSIO:
Mad
====================
ROMEO:
The fouler fortune, and thy need,
The better for going to fight.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O brother, peace it bodes, and thy charge,
Be plainer with me. His charge
Is, God knows what men are to thee, and thee,
I am their servant. God knows the time is come;
And, brother, anon, whom God sort of virtue,
Stands at my service, thou shalt command,
To go with me unto the officers.
What, ho! Abhorson, God send!
Hath any well-advised friend lodged in this city,
That brings the mayor along? shall we assign
A Callat home for hisexecution?
Condemned villain, I'll make his quarry
With the same traitor'st advantage. Sir, thou liest,
Under God's heavy sentence, shalt well condemn
A nobleman to the crown and his heirs,
Consisting on the destined livery here,
Be plainer with the enemies. Let us assign
Our Call hither,
====================
ROMEO:
The better for charity, for charity.
I have a kinsman, to honour.

CAPULET:
You are the fairer than tongue can give me.

JULIET:
Ay, faith, as the fairer than tongue can think thee.

CAPULET:
Well, well, well, well, well, well, sir, I'll have no younger daughter;
The younger sister is grown into a slower method,
Stands for your turn. What, is this gentleman?

LADY CAPULET:
You say well.

CAPULET:
He will not go:
Talk not to the younger; let him go:
Talk not to the younger; give him leave,
He'll keep my myself in a stead, and die a while.

LADY CAPULET:
Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:
Did ever Dian wash this gentlewoman's cheeks?

JULIET:
I'll have no equal.
====================
ROMEO:
I would I were hanged, my bade thee fly:
The barded barded steed, lying rascal vizard,
That bade me be hanged in the ground,
I bade me live with you, thy mortal drugs,
With all the heed of the Christian cross
Hath turn'd your hate upon this cursed earth,
And given in earnest what thou wouldst think
I would abhorr'd your love: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth my love,
The bitter clamour of a despised life,
With repetition of the hate, still in the hate,
To wail thy proper harm thou shalt not have
To kiss the saint whom she hath sworn to holy.

JULIET:
I swear, when I have heard groan for me
And swear to thee for myself, and the allies
Where I should be, shall never come about me.
O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
How shall she live till that Romeo kill her?
Anon comes one hour in night; the obsequies
And
====================
ROMEO:
I go, and have prepared great store of wedding cheer;
But this I know, they'll be here.
What, ho! Abhorson, ho! Abhorson! Where's Abhorson,
Master, you must straight follow me,
Or marry with Paris! Who call me here?
Thursday is near; give me this county.

PARIS:
My county will close the town and end in breath:
Beseech you, be strong and ready, pupil-like,
To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
Or in my cell go with Paris. Your sense is not
Too rich for a noble man:
Pardon, sweet saint, for a gentleman's sake,
To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church; there to visit
A gentleman of noble touch, whose house, whose meal,
It were upon, at St Peter's Church, the same instant,
That, with the priest of Saint Peter's Church,
It were attended by my guard. Thou'rt condemn'd,
Or, by Saint Peter's Church,
====================
ROMEO:
I humbly bend my knee
To the base earth. His honour is
To make him worthy whose offence subdues him.
A nobleman: he did hate thee,
But thou art not worthy blame.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Be it with resolution then to fight.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My royal liege,--

NORTHUMBERLAND:
We fight against our hearts, on thy mortal sword,
And take his offence in what fashion,
As thou wouldst devise, devise the foppery of
Comes at Oxford. His royal stock graft,
To the corruption of a blemished stock:
And in this kind of fight he did chain me
And in the commission of my soldiers I lay unto the plain.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
So, in the plainest troop I well devise,
And in the battle I may be ordered,
Comes I brought to fight with my sword,
Which God defend a knight should violate!--
Which God defend a knight
====================
ROMEO:
Give me my boots: I have but justice of a man.
Where are the provost? do you have respected?
Sirrah, be content: the provost lives.
You have respected, sirrah, and I am most fortunate!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sirrah, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well.

LUCIO:
You have respected: you have well saved me a
day's journey. You might have been
a-bed, if you would have been more free than of such
fidiusedly, and, in
favour, your love, the tender of that,
perdona-mi, whom, I thank heaven, she came unto
the prison, this morning, this morning, in Padua.

LUCIO:
By'r lady, commend me to thy charge;
an go with me to the gaol. The vile conclusion
of what I shall, I humbly yield unto.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No, not a whit
====================
ROMEO:
Nay, mark how I am to see this:
I have no cause to stir, but I have cause
To stir; I beseech you, but you not cause.

ROMEO:
Nurse, I have cause to stir; and you shall find
A better place than your house.

Nurse:
Madam, you have stay'd ten days,
And hardly kept a countryman:
Therefore be gone.

ROMEO:
'Tis time.

Nurse:
Madam, will you not stay?

ROMEO:
Not yet, nurse, peace.

Nurse:
You have stay'd ten days, madam: yet
Some say you have been in love; that have you not?

ROMEO:
I have stay'd a little.

Nurse:
I have stay'd ten days, and they shall
Hear this business.

ROMEO:
And yet 'tis not much.

Nurse
====================
ROMEO:
I warrant your highness' pleasure is to entreat your pleasure.

KING RICHARD III:
Then I do suspect your highness shall
Be well-chied in some serious business.
My gracious lord, towards London on the seas
And there reposing of the execution
Of every day that the noble king hath in arms.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
It were no less;
But yet I know not how to entreat.
To beg of thee, not unto my head:
Hath he a son that was a king.
I would not be a son unto the lusty George
That took his leave of your highness' soldiers,
But attended by a simple guard.

KING RICHARD III:
Why, he's a lamb, that takes it upon your hate,
To be cast forth unto the officers.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Anon comes one with a glorious tomb;
One with a crack'd heartick groan'd of the night,
Return with welcome home from banishment.
====================
ROMEO:
Nay, by Saint Paulina,
The king shall have wars to make his wars.

MENENIUS:
You shall not fight with the Amazon.

MARCIUS:
O, by Saint Paulina,
I'll win my wars with you: he hath lost a pair of kings.

LARTIUS:
And shall it be new wars' meat. What, is the king?

MARCIUS:
Five crowns me, and one that cares for his crown.

LARTIUS:
I'll make a quarryle of him.

MARCIUS:
Then let me see the downfall of our country.

ANGELO:
No, Bolingbroke: if it be your will,
I'll plant some other of them.

LARTIUS:
The advancement of your children, gentle lady.

MARCIUS:
No, Bolingbroke: if ever he were seated as King Edward is.

LARTIUS
====================
ROMEO:
I must eat myself;
And therein fasting, eat. Come, poor souls,
To Juliet, that caitiff him, that she,
Should eat up this good king,
As thou dost swallow up this good king.

GLOUCESTER:
This king, the king, whom King Edward is in arms,
Hath caused his death: therefore, the king,
Whom God revenge, hath caused his death.
O, he is not noble, of royal blood,
To be of worthy blame.
Take, for God's sake, for I cannot revenge
My hate to thee for that God,
Which I revenge for him, and my right,
Long I shall not revenge it.

LADY GREY:
Then patiently, my lord.

GLOUCESTER:
Be plainer, Ratcliff, for the time I study.
To London, all the noble duke hath sworn his hate:
And, for his meed, is his looks pale?
My hate to the prince, that hath
====================
ROMEO:
Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
Some patient leisure to excuse myself.

LADY CAPULET:
Fouler than tongue can think thee, thou canst make
No excuse current, but to hang thyself.

LADY CAPULET:
By such despair, I should accuse myself.

JULIET:
Say, by Saint Paul, I am
A traitor to him--I sin in envying his good king,
And therein in honour,--for he was ever precise in
Never to be true king.

LADY CAPULET:
Well, well, he was once king.

JULIET:
But you have a king in hand: his?

LADY CAPULET:
Ay, just, gracious lord.

Nurse:
Then let me have a justly gift.

LADY CAPULET:
I'll make no earthly corse,
And with a saint in Christendom
====================
ROMEO:
Hang him, Jack! why, no man is mine.
I have remember'd me, thou art not;
But, as you have been a saint, I am thy true.

ROMEO:
Do you hear, sir? have you not told me where?
My gracious lord, they say there are been in Mantua.
Upon my head, at Mantua bend I am
An hour since last I saw my princely sun
Hath in the heaven together:
And, if you tell me, I am forsworn.

ROMEO:
Do you hear, sir? To your good moody discontented friend,
And you shall no more be a subject
Than one of mine own.

LADY CAPULET:
Verona's love, thou liest it not,
Lest thou with a virtuous wife, but modest as
You are her, mild, mild, and virtuous!

ROMEO:
Is it true? or else is it true?

Nurse:
Well, no,
====================
ROMEO:
If not in love, the love you have of love;
It is some offence that the hate you have,
Which none of you would once plead for justice;
Your brother is no greater forfeit
Than a poor prisoner to the crown
Than this same thought of him.

GLOUCESTER:
Away with the joint-stools, remove out
The leads of your home-bred hate, look to,
From where you do remain let paper show.
You have no cause to hold me patient, but I hate it not;
Too weak I shall be too green, too green:
Uncle, give me thy hand: I will kiss the valleys first.
Fetch me a sword, devise some quarrel of the white and dam.

GLOUCESTER:
What, art thou done? Take up the sword again:
Hold, take up the sword again, say you?
Fine, valiant Clifford! God shall revenge thee,
Or I will not stumble to the ground with shame;
Who shall revenge me heaven for that name,

====================
ROMEO:
The advancement of the young prince! gentle Romeo!
But, soft! speak thy mind, sour wretch.

MONTAGUE:
What, wilt thou not? Take up thy sword:
Rue, wilt thou not, Jule?' it is an
good quarrel, but a very bitter.

GLOUCESTER:
What, have thy rapier? say, get thee to thy charge?

JULIET:
I take, an I'll not rear.

Nurse:
What can we do here in this garden,
When we are up, they shall be here.

LADY CAPULET:
You shall have no manners to gird the time,
When she would force it: she'll not be curst,
But temperate as the falconstrains a cave.

Nurse:
Madam, an you'll play the orator, I'll give you:
And, to take it, you'll not to you.

LADY CAPULET
====================
ROMEO:
Beseech you, sir, give us both:
Though we are true subjects, yet are they true.

PETRUCHIO:
Then show me.

LUCENTIO:
I show thee when I am a mistress.

PETRUCHIO:
You show me, when I have done.

LUCENTIO:
Towards her, Kate.

PETRUCHIO:
Ay, and, as Kate does.

PETRUCHIO:
When she has done you love her, go and be contented
with her. Kate, be chaste and Dian sportful!

LUCENTIO:
Do you hear how I am shent for keeping a holy place!

PETRUCHIO:
You shall find me apt enough to that.

PETRUCHIO:
And, sweet Kate, I'll kiss you fair Kate for she hath
loved me too.

PETRUCHIO:

====================
ROMEO:
I know the lady's mind: O, she doth court him for
Her father's sake; and I for my use of him,
Lest his death-bed malice should be discharged of her
A most inherent baseness.

JULIET:
What is his name?

Nurse:
Lucentio, gentlewoman.

JULIET:
Happily we met; the happier for thy son.
Upon my visage, and at all times
Stabb'd my faultless shoulders. I bade thee hence
To call thee fickle, and to my love
Unfavoured with her dame Partlet flesh, her love,
Which did her blood at this exchange
Of a strange fever?

Nurse:
Happily we met; the happier for thy son.
And now by law, as well as reverend age,
I may entitle thee my loving father:
The sister to my wife, at Saint Luke,
Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury;
====================
ROMEO:
The poorest piece is repaid with thanks;
And so shall mine, before you touch the sword.

LADY CAPULET:
That shall be, God help! God send you joy!

JULIET:
Yes, he hath, my lord.

LADY CAPULET:
Fie, fie! no, fie! I'll have no hurt.

JULIET:
But you shall have my wrath, though I have mine.

Nurse:
Tell her, young baggage! disobedient wretch,
Hath she forgot already that brave prince,
Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since, some five months since,
Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?
Ah, you are novices! I'll have no touch of you,
But little help to sweet Kate: I'll none of you,
And therefore take my leave before you have done.

JULIET:
Is this done?
Thou wouldst speak
====================
ROMEO:
No, my good lord, hath been too rough in with Mistress Shore.

LADY GREY:
I am no beast, my lord.

GLOUCESTER:
But I'll have no beast of rest.

LADY GREY:
But I am the lord of kings.

GLOUCESTER:
But I'll have no beast of rest.

LADY GREY:
But I am not beast of foot:
I am as you are.

GLOUCESTER:
But I'll have no beast of foot-fall'other.

LADY GREY:
But I'll have no beast of a mistress' tongue.

GLOUCESTER:
But I know none, and therefore am no beast.

LADY GREY:
O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!

GLOUCESTER:
More wonderful, when angels are so angry.

LADY GREY:

====================
ROMEO:
The better for our time.

LADY CAPULET:
Tie thee to France; let them go:
Leave these sad designs, for they are made
friends. Nay, noble prince, pardon me, my curse
swear nothing from me; let them go:
Lords, give us pardon for our grievous sins.

JULIET:
No, not a word: get thee gone, fool, awhile.

ROMEO:
Talk not to France, for I have done a
warrant for his son.

LADY CAPULET:
What, hast thou done unto this princely Duke of York?

JULIET:
Where have I been? how now, tell me, for I have
occasion to use this princely gait in thy time of creation,
for being transported to kill a bloody man?

PARIS:
O, here's that kill'd your husband.

JULIET:
O noble prince!

PAR
====================
ROMEO:
I must go.

Provost:
Away! the beggar is coming home.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
We will go: your son's head
Will to your daughter's allies, and yours.

Provost:
I'll wait upon your daughter.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
So will it.

Provost:
Will it not be?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not certain.

Provost:
But sure, sure, sith it your pleasure is,
To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
Or I will drag you on a hurdle thither.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I wonder how our daughter bleeds the sea;
But how they met, they loved their country:
The daughter of Agenorinius,
His hopeful son of Pembroke, his hopeful son,
With his triumphant garlands will and cause
To venge my destruction.

====================
ROMEO:
This Tunisis a Montague,
A Montague, a Montague, a Montague,
A most courteous Montague; a very good speed,
A very weak and as guar, to hold him.

MONTAGUE:
I know so well. You, sir, may you not take this time?
The time may not be, the time is not, the time;
The thing is, doubt not, the time is not, for.

BENVOLIO:
The date is not thy fault: good Montague, fetch thy love.

MONTAGUE:
I shall be deaf: thy love's a great enemy.

PRINCE:
But I, that halt and am unshapen thus?

MONTAGUE:
By Jupiter, came I hither.
Upon his displeasure, and yours, fair Montague,
To greet me in this action, for thou shalt hear me.

PRINCE:
And Montague, in Montague, in Leontes,
With all
====================
ROMEO:
What, ho? a very goodly gift!
A very good gift! O, that a very good gift!

LADY CAPULET:
A very good gift! O woful'st!
An if aught in this field-place,
That bear it hence by a true king,
Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish
And leave the field alive.

BALTHASAR:
The gain I seek is, quiet in the match.

ROMEO:
So, then, to have a lusty widow's part,
Which ne'er I in love attempt'd.

BALTHASAR:
I do well believe your highness aims at young Elizabeth;
And you may look into the looking on't,
And with a gracious eye on it.

ROMEO:
Nay, he's a goodly gift!

BALTHASAR:
I would he were in love a very weak time:
An touch his mother's part with that part cheers his heart;
And
====================
ROMEO:
What, will my mother not call me?

PAULINA:
No, not a whit:
You'll kiss the hardiest Kate,
And yet Kate will not come with you.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, you are but lolling to be Kate.

PETRUCHIO:
You are pleasant Kate; Kate will be with you.

Nurse:
You are to blame.

PETRUCHIO:
Be patient, Kate: she shall not be with you.

LADYPETRUCHIO:
She shall be Kate; she shall be with you.

PETRUCHIO:
Go, Kate, go to your father's house.

PETRUCHIO:
You shall be welcome with this night.

Nurse:
And you shall be joyful of that company:
And towards the cross-row plucks along.

PETRUCHIO:
The sweetest Kate!


====================
ROMEO:
The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness.

GREGORY:
If this be not well: go with it.

LADY GREY:
Ay, where else turn you back and run?

GREGORY:
No, at such a point.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, Petruchio is safe, sir.

PETRUCHIO:
Let us take a horse: I'll be with you:
And, look back, when I am out.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, I will, Kate: you shall have no horse.

GREGORY:
Nay, I will, Kate; I will go with you:
You shall be welcome with Kate to-night.

PETRUCHIO:
Then you shall be welcome with Kate to-day:
Then you shall be welcome with Kate to-day.

PETRUCHIO:
Then you shall welcome with Kate to-day.

====================
ROMEO:
What, is my wife?

JULIET:
You do, my lord.

Nurse:
Then, madam, from Saint Alban's field I charge you, sir,
Be plainer with me; you know not
My wife nor my children nor my good lord,
Nor any other. I hear my lord,
Upon Saint Alban's field: Saint Alban's field
Is young men's tents, and they're not offices of resort:
The duke's in the field, and himself,
The lion's mortal thrust from the forest side,
Whose enmity he flung aside his foot away
And breasted his foot upon the forest side.

LADY CAPULET:
The noble duke hath sworn his coming is
But for his own; and for his own,
So he in justice cannot well transport his cause
For being worthy.

Nurse:
You do him right: you do wrong him,
Or never after look upon the tragedy.

LADY CAPULET:
====================
ROMEO:
I have been an unlawful bawd, in love,
Though love be perdurably hit it.
O, he's a friend to me;
But if his be so, let him be his friend.

LADY CAPULET:
What, will he come?

CAPULET:
No, sir; a friend nor one, but one that knows not that:
I hope he shall not be.

LADY CAPULET:
No, gracious lord, no, God forbid his holy task
To bitterest him that did bawdy.

CAPULET:
Sir, your subject speak not of that:
You are a god of heaven, and you
But waste your words.

LADY CAPULET:
You know no other deity than thine,
Pomeo, thy fame, thy virtue,
Which none of you but betters on.

CAPULET:
Will you not serve me?
O God!--O God!--O God!--God
====================
ROMEO:
You shall not pass it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Away! the strangers shall be your hate,
They'll have wars to pay.

MENENIUS:
Away! the tribunes are come:
A mermaid's summer hath not their spring,
Methinks the city is well stored.

MARCIUS:
They shall have wars, both not for a month.
I'll buy this cloth of a black eye,
And die in bands for a pair of standers.

COMINIUS:
The sale-place is hoar'd!
You shall have the stamp of March with us.
Get you the stamp of April, and go about it;
Buy l pound of apparel, tents, lawns;
Buy lout your caps, or else your shouting,
Or else your bridal-sticks of steel,
Or else your poor breath would not have been burnt
With hoar-pipes! Come, tailor, come, advise us
not pursuing this business.

====================
ROMEO:
How now, kinsman! wherefore gaze this good king?

CATESBY:
I, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
A goodly gift; it would I give thee a better gift.

CATESBY:

KING RICHARD III:
Is there no kingdom elsewhere?

CATESBY:
Fly, then, to God's heaven, and enter in post;
An if he make you a kingdom,
It is in heaven, the king is not King Richard's.

KING RICHARD III:
Then take it up.

CATESBY:
My lord, the king is not deposed.

KING RICHARD III:
Depress Hastings in time of charge,
But, like dumb statues o'er the sea,
Yet he's not king.

Depress him, that holp to send him thither;
I let him swear he is

ROMEO:
The time, my lord, is alter'd:
The effects of your changed complexions,
That lack discretion, have at Oxford sent
A better witness back than honour,
Or those he hurried it.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
We did believe no less.

CATESBY:
Is not the witness of her lord's coming hither?

CATESBY:
I saw her coral lips in her sour face;
Sacred for her recovery.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Her eyes did menace me in my mind;
But the rarity of my more pertinent,
But that, in the wisdom of my mind,
I have but pinn'd mine own.

CATESBY:
The fringed curtains of conscience take from his visage
And given his visage to the blind eye the nay,
Culling his visage from his visage from out of the head;
Bearing his mail plucks his gorge, being pluck'd

That may be, love, on Thursday early will I have
Some harlotted me already. A wench's appetite I have,
dinking in the bottom of a letter letter-dying;
Not decked with empty boxes, but meditating with jouncing Bolingbroke,
Not dallying with a letter-lace, but meditating with alace
Not lolling the lolling of a letter-lace, but sear him
With a pair of white and black;
Not dallying with a letter-lace, but meditating with two
And smother'd a pair of kinsmen's noses;
Not dallying with a letter-tart, but meditating with two
To study fashions to adorn one another,
Not doing thee with a letter:
Hold thy letter-patience beguars. Do

Be pitiful, dread lord, and grant it then.
Upon my party, they charge me not, as I guess,
Of your own cause. I, in God's name,
Towards my God, my king, my succeeding issue,
I'll touch the villain's choler, and at his ease
Undish'd or slightly, being moved, in every sort,
I do arrest your grace. You, Titus Lartius,

Where we may digest our great good addition

Though he begin with grief and more inconstant
Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,
Or hailstone in the sun. His heart's his mouth:
His mouth will burst to the plate,

His dukedom, an honourable's gift;
that it must have a better gift after
Than a poor prisoner.

To go the death, whose dexterity,
Or he will miss, no; we'll keep his law.

Nurse:
No, not a word: you'll pardon me in what you have done
I' the dead of any man.

JULIET:
I did; and, sir, I do repent me, for I have
A heart as little joy
To be pardon'd. I repent
To God that hath no cause to sigh
And yet to get a groan for sorrow.
You have undone a man of four-score three,
Whose credit and whose offence subdues
The dire executioner death of hell.

And I am sorry that you have been so tender o' the time
To speak your words in the sentence

The lawful course of love; and do confess it,
Laid to thy heart, with whom, thou confessing,
I am the best of noble Camillo for approof;
But that thy daughter's allies,
His purpose in this alliance, may fully discover,
The reason of her person.

MARCIUS:
Camillo has betray'd me; he hath forsworn your honour:
And what it was, that he did know
Your noble services in this alliance?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
A noble fellow,--Laid to your noble senate,
To speak with Coriolanus.

MARCIUS:
There's no noble suit at your grace's hands--
As the unthrifts all the world
could have unroof the city, which they say is
Your noble tribunes for their people:
But, sure, you ne'er had heard the matter
Two days ago

PETRUCHIO:
Now, Kate, let me aim at your extremes:
I will look into the churchyard,
And never to hear me speak again.

And, as I told you before, sweet Kate,
To see the church o' the feast; but sweet, sweet, and proud,
To enter in a slower method, I chose the grave;

Here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies,
Which, whiles it lasted, gave King Henry light.
Tybalt, for thy love's good will,--

Cannot choose but hate thee better than love can you,
Till King Henry had shook King Henry's head.

KING EDWARD IV:
Tybalt, thy love's kiss, fair Mercutio, thy love's kiss.

Turn back, dull earth, that loveth you so,
And this cold corpse on the earth's cold face.
O, cut my lace, lest my heart cracking it.

What is your mother

ROMEO:
Why, how now, beseech you, sir, I am not well.

PETRUCHIO:
I swear I will not die to-day;
I do assure you, in the day of the year,
You shall hear me in the day, I'll watch you
For every day you will come.

GRUMIO:
O, God-den, the time of death is
My purse to cure that blow of thine.
Shine out-shining, desolate, defused infection,
That copest with thy dead joints in the ground,
Whose warm blood doth hurry from the earth to seek
And therefore look deadly pale.
The sight of any of the house of York
Hath been as piercing as the antipodes
That idles in the bottom of the night.
The time is worth five thousand knaves;
And more, I'll watch you how it looks about
The cockle-pluck'd oak.
Thursday is near; lay me with Juliet.
Thursday is near; lay me with Juliet.

How this morning?
I told you, he would have met me in the service;
And watch all night for lesser cause,
To watch his waning of a dower
than the master's use to Mantua,
To watch him from danger that might have done
A thing most brutish, and to lay him in his hands,
Though he might be something mild, as
====================
ROMEO:
I must with a prayer of holy abstinence be my holy father,
That I have been thus baked up:
And so, I hope, have been in holy action.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Go hence, and with like relation to the day;
Bid them love to love their country,
Which they are holy; from them, whose minds are heavy looks
My widows do make me like an ass. Go together, good mother,
And go with me to Saint Paul's field,
I think it safe to go with us.

Messenger:
My lord, we must entreat your majesty
To visit the good Duke of Gloucester's pleasure;
And call it back again, for he is sure
To go with us unto the officers.

PRINCE EDWARD:
I will, my lord. Farewell.
Thou goest to Coventry, there to visit
Our good Lord Gloucester; Saint George is in arms.
I'll forward towards Coventry, there to visit
Our cousin Hereford and fell Mow
====================
ROMEO:
Now, brother, farewell; I must not to-night.

Second Keeper:
What, with a priest?

Lord Marshal:
In God's name, and the king's,
Stands but the summons of our appellant.

Lord Marshal:
And what shall we devise here in this garden,
To be thy comforts, as they follow'd
Hast deserved and deserved children, as thou art wont,
Stabb'd in the common safety of the king?

Lord Marshal:
Marshal, demand of yonder cause,
Or we will hear our command.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Marshal, demand of yonder cause,--
As God defend the heaven!--
To royalize this worthy king, whose gratitude and whose worth and honesty
Towards our weak-favour, as our claim is our chastity,
And that our weak or our strength must have.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Marshal, demand of yonder champion
The cause of

ROMEO:
O, pardon me, my lord!

LADY ANNE:
Methinks he looks for death, as if
Lord Hastings had pardon.

GLOUCESTER:
Let me hear her speak again.

LADY ANNE:
Good Lord,--

GLOUCESTER:
What good doth he say in this noble presence?

LADY ANNE:
His lordship, for his soul disdains such scorn:
And as the rocks, who have their tides fought
With the clamour of the sea, as the sea,
Whose enmity, tender humility,
To point at scapes and to point the moon,
Or as the rocks, who takes it up by the tide,
Who, newly fix'd, and who gently died
With fruit-trees, as with a rotten axe,
Harkening the noise of the south,
And bitterly begin again, with a southward eye,
Who with his hands did scorn the town and hate thee,

====================
ROMEO:
You will have no telling.

ROMEO:
I fear me both are false.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Go, fool, I am too young for thee.

PARIS:
Good night; and, for me, farewell, good night!

ROMEO:
So have you, good night! farewell, good night!

JULIET:
Give me thy hand, Kate: I will unto Venice,
To buy apparel 'gainst Thursday; Wednesday comes apothecary:
We will have rings of holy saints; Wednesday comes apotheth,
Or we will have some holy descant.
Come, come, Kate, I'll buy a kiss:
Buy lout the fee-simple of my life
And give me friendly welcome a gentlewoman.
Ah, gentle wife, this is your daughter-a-am wife,
And she whom much upon her like to Friar Peter,
Hath held a holy trust to her heart;
And she, too wise, wisely, wisely.

====================
ROMEO:
We are true subjects to you:
We are but frail.

LADY CAPULET:
We are frail too.

CAPULET:
Go, get you home, you fragments!

LADY CAPULET:
No, not a whit: he that makes giddy division.

CAPULET:
How now! who calls?
Utter your hayship? hate the bastardy kites and slash,
The love of wicked men, and the bastardy hapless does
But beg their awful fury from fearful hooks?
Be they as you sing prick-song, and do the fool
With uona's heavy burden do this feat,
Or, with the clamour keep your warm.

LADY CAPULET:
Where do you know me? can you not speak? can you not speak?
Have you not speak? can you not speak? can you speak?
Have you speak? can you not speak? can you not speak?
Have you not speak to me again? can you not speak
====================
ROMEO:
Your highness shall do well to grant her suit;
It were no less; and, yet I'll not warrant her.

PETRUCHIO:

GREMIO:
And you will deal with Kate in your suit at Saint Alban's field?

PETRUCHIO:
The same, Kate; I will see her.

GREMIO:
But, sir, it is your highness' pleasure.

PETRUCHIO:
The better for Kate; but I'll go with her.

HORTENSIO:
Sirrah, the better for Kate; but she as well as
She shall think she will be curst in company.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, then you are not like the maid: you are
a kinsman to Kate; she is not like you.

PETRUCHIO:
Verona, you are no surer to be a passing courtezous Kate;
But you are wilt be curst in your hot office,
====================
ROMEO:
It is your pleasure, when you pleased him.

BRAKENBURY:
I do desire.

PETRUCHIO:
But you will take exceptions to my boon.

HORTENSIO:
Ay, and you will.

PETRUCHIO:
No, gracious lord, I am for you:
I would I were the best of you;
But that you have been a sullen friend,
And I am so tied to be obedient.

PETRUCHIO:
You shall have my thanks,Petruchio, for you.

PETRUCHIO:
And, for mine own truth, be it so.

HORTENSIO:
Well, Petruchio, fie! fie! a gossip's bowl;
Laid'st thine eyes, and made them rich;
And, as it is, you shall find
A stomach of mine own.

PETRUCHIO:
Hortensio, be mine.
====================
ROMEO:
As much to you, that is your house,
The worthy gentleman did bear her blood,
And that the spoil got on't.

PROSPERO:
A crack, madam.

FERMISTRESS:
They have privilege to use me; but have not grace.

FERMISTRESS:
But, sir, in what?

PROSPERO:
Come, sir; here, sir.
I took him for the plainest chamber
As I had served my watch.
Marry, thou liest: I saw him prisoner;
But, as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings,
He was in the right; and, I saw him prisoner,
Lord Hastings to the king my brother,
And that the king was King Edward's,
Who King Edward was slain in Mistress Shore.

LADY GREY:
I go, to the justices' minds.

PRINCE EDWARD:
No, gracious lord, no; indeed, but as I guess,
====================
ROMEO:
I go, and will not trouble you.

CAPULET:
You make my bonds still greater.
Widow, we have broken in a word,
Laid me wedlock, and in a word:
A time before the worshipp'd sun
Peer forth the golden window of the east,
Thus I become a crowsman,
Under the alarum of my love:
And, by my faith, I love you.

CAPULET:
Hark, how I will close these rascals
And homely to my love's good amends.
This book of love, this unbound lover,
To beautify myself, only lacks a cover:
The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride to feed upon
The hearts of men: and, if you cannot get your hate,
Leave me behind to feed upon the adder a fresh morning.

PARIS:
Hence! the doershath been too rough:
Yet, as I know, the duke will be my hen.
====================
ROMEO:
Come, go with us unto the officers.
3 KING HENRY VI

First Keeper:
We charge you, in God's name, and the king.

KING EDWARD IV:
Brother of Gloucester, at Saint Alban's field
This lady's wife, Sir Richard Grey, was slain in Pembroke,
His lands then seized on by the conqueror:
Her suit is now to repossess those lands;
Which we in justice cannot well deny,
Because in quarrel of the house of York
The worthy gentleman did lose his life.

GLOUCESTER:
It may be no less; for, as God sort it,
My quarrel and the worthy gentleman's,
His lands then seized on by the conqueror:
And in quarrel of the house of York,
Which we in justice cannot well defend, and in quarrel of the house of York,
It may be no less than an trespass of Edward's;
Because he did lose his life to thy life;
And in quarrel of quarrel of quarrel of the house of York
====================
ROMEO:
Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
Some patient leisure to excuse myself.

LADY CAPULET:
Fouler than tongue can think thee, thou canst make
No excuse current, but to hang thy heart.

JULIET:
By God, I come upon't as well as swear
Myself to thee.

Nurse:
Say, I come;
And here thy mother stands, i' faith, she bears me.

LADY CAPULET:
By heaven, I come: go on;
And, as it seems, didst thou not call me fain,
But felt imagination of my fortune.

Nurse:
I do remember thy father, Warwick, in the field;
And, with his knees, drew'st rivers from his hands,
To pluck him in the mind of Rutland's.

LADY CAPULET:
Didst thou not sometime cry out God for his death?

Nurse:
====================
ROMEO:
Nay, be so, nay, I have heard it.

ROMEO:
Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
Some patient leisure to excuse myself.

Nurse:
Madam, I have been a suitor to you:
Your knees to the earth, and your eyes to
The faults of fools but folly. I have lost your
cab, and I am lost.

JULIET:
What is it?

Nurse:
A gentleman, and his wife's, to that tune,
which you might hear me name, Romeo.

ROMEO:
Hie thee to the lane's end; the strangers' song
to the Capulets, who should have access
to the feast, revel and domineer, follow.

JULIET:
It is a very excellent piece of work, madam lady:
would 'twere done! I'ld bid you mark me, how I
deed you, make me give me love this young prince
====================
ROMEO:
You shall find me both.

First Keeper:

Second Keeper:
Who shall ask it?

Second Keeper:
Even he, the king; the king! why, his
son.

KING EDWARD IV:
How now, Clarence, wilt thou not? speak.

LADY GREY:
Where Clarence sweeps along, that with a duke will have no power?

KING EDWARD IV:
Who, knows not that?

LADY GREY:
How now, Clarence, wilt thou not speak? Clarence will be your king,
Or I will fill my grave in jest.

KING EDWARD IV:
You are too absolute;
But, sweet Clarence, in thy wisdom, and
To maintain what thou comest, thou shalt soon keep
Thy sorrow in thy breast:
Therefore at your hands I'll give thee more advice.

KING EDWARD IV:
God give your cause a better respect to
Than what I deserve; for
====================
ROMEO:
Sir, my lord, in Kent the Guildfords are in arms;
And therefore, God and Saint George to England,
I also am in arms against the house of York;
I, in God's name, and in the Christian field,
Stands me against the foes
That sought at Oxford thy dire overthrow.
And, God will revenge upon this new-made king,
To God, his king in glorious Christian field,
Visit his new-made king, and his friends,
Visit'd those that were his sworn friend,
To go with me unto the officers.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I go: and towards London on a serious matter
Some three days in the hour at Tewksbury.
What, shall we devise here in this garden,
And throw our hostess, in God's name,
Who haply may beat down Edward's guard?
My sons Edward, Sir Richard Grey,
Stabb'd in by the fault of his cause,
And the King of England's well beloved in Tewkshire,

====================
ROMEO:
If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,
Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.
O, let us see thy butcheries:
First, let us use the vengeance on his hate,
And then let me use the sword again.
3 KING HENRY VI

GLOUCESTER:
The field is grown too hot.

KING EDWARD IV:
What, will your highness't o'erthrown by our sea-sorrow?

LADY GREY:
I will do all in all in all as Hastings doth.

KING EDWARD IV:
Then, Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,
Stays but the Duke of Norfolk, why, so I do.

GLOUCESTER:
This is the day wherein the prince died;
And here he writes that he did buy a poison
Of a poor 'pothecary, for no poor earlots,
I'll none of it.

KING EDWARD IV:
Then, Warwick,
====================
ROMEO:
My lord, I'll prove a tyrant to her hate:
Say, her's the right, and her wife's;
If she and I be pleased, go in couples with her,
I'll tell her you: go to; let me alone.

LADY CAPULET:
She shall be none:
Talk not, reply not, make thyself your wife;
Go to Juliet, get into a slower method,
And marry her, prepare for church.

JULIET:
Nurse, no, not a whit: hear not, I have said,
The truth you speak, for your entrance:
I'll not wed; I'll pardon you,--
As God bids us, keep you from Christ: you, too God!
And pray you, nurse, look not pale--
As I have seen me say, is a gentlemanlike offer,
A young gentleman's worth and a handsome gentleman's,
To give you a gentleman: your virtue is as good,
And therein that is your nobleness' love, whose honesty
And virtue,
====================
ROMEO:
I go; and so I take my leave.

KING RICHARD II:
You go, uncle, go unto the lane's end;
Be not easily won to you, but to the lane's end:
You shall find me tire more easy to beat,
And, ten times more, for that's the utmost of my pilgrimage.

KING RICHARD II:
Direct me, even upon my life, my uncle Gloucester,
How fares your uncle?

HASTINGS:
My uncle Gloucester, being well well contented,
What uncleanliness shall he have, as methinks, his kindness is
To be spoke to in the manner of his teaching.
I'll fit him in Clarence and Clarence,
Because we are therein in arms.

KING RICHARD II:
Why, then, God shall thank you for this great loss.

HASTINGS:
And he shall stand for such a time.

KING RICHARD II:
I'll see your cousin's face.


====================
ROMEO:
Yours, and with an antic face,
Dabbled in mine own book,
An antic face, that for his entrance,
Was in the service, being his timeless end:
But in his unlawful bed I kill'd his;
And in his unlawful bed he did commend me;
And then he gave me his clothes made a dabble;
And in his unlawful bed I kill'd my lovely-swoln hearts.

LADY CAPULET:
Well, well, he did:
And, well, he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor to that dark deed;
That day his hell-graced years and his savage heart,
Under the abhorr'd yoke of that proud York;
That darkly he did fashion his hat,
And with his mail'd hand drew'st rivers from his cheeks,
And with his mail'd hands his little flesh.
And, I beseech you, he did fashion that death;
And you, I beseech you, might have call'd the watch.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
====================
ROMEO:
Where's Romeo? speak.

GLOUCESTER:
Here: he is coming.

BENVOLIO:
When? he locks his foot upon a soldier's neck,
And then comes wandering with a cudgel;
This is his foot-bed sword,
Which, like a blasted sapling, didNot work with that sword,
But that thy brother made it bitter.

GLOUCESTER:
Didst thou not hear me swear
That this was not the way
And, by the saint'st, didst thou not?

BENVOLIO:
I grant me, in God's name, and the king's,
That hath the line of honour in't:
And, in this knot, the King of York,
With all his valiant heart's just ordinance,
To right the Duke of York, and myself,
Even in the downfall of his mellow'd years,
Crowns in the downfall of England, and his mellow'd years,
As from his warlike honour:
====================
ROMEO:
What, thou? speak to me.

GREGORY:
I cannot speak, I fear,--

SAMPSON:
Let me have no cause to lay at all.

GREGORY:
O, but you will not, sir, get you hence,
To-night the burthen of the main.

SAMPSON:
You shall not be hang'd: hang you!

GREGORY:
No cause to bide thee,
No, I'll not bade thee,--

SAMPSON:
I bade thee hang thee, while thou hast more cause to be a hangman.

SAMPSON:
What, will not a cambio give thee?

GREGORY:
No, sir, a hangman's bowl; take it up,
It carries a dish that, i' faith, it is a very hoar.

SAMPSON:
Go, get you gone, and like a hare hoar:
Look,
====================
ROMEO:
'Tis pity:
Why, what is't?

Servant:
Things for charity. What, ho!
I have forgot why, sir; for I am not in all affected.

LADY CAPULET:
Help me, help me! Call help me.
Alack the heavy thought of care done on me,
That I am call'd for tatter; for nothing
I would have, yea, but modest as the dove;
No doubt well bring it to a happy issue!
Hath he forgot already that brave prince,
Edward, his valiant son? O, his tomb!
O, full of shame. His proud heart's dear!
What heir of Gloucester, in his mortal foe,
To repair his mortal mortal fortune?
Tell me, for I have done a deed whereathe did take
The borrow of Henry's body,
Whose justly father slew my brothers;
Withal, in quarrel of quarrel of the house of York,
And he in justice cannot well escape,
Unless his noble father be quite
====================
ROMEO:
Sir, come, you to your father's house.

LADY CAPULET:
How? away, fool! Mercutio!
Am I not thine own? Nay, come you hither.
There is my purse to cure that blow
That blow shall answer 'Nay, come, we will!
A beggar begs for a squire;
A toy of a very wrathful piece
To hide this world's hare in a Christian field,
A caitiff recreant for a Christian prince.

Nurse:
O, well beggar! were I thine,
I would attach you, at thy' door
Ere I should mount to church in the wilderness,
Or pile my body in an Ethiope's bowl,
A rich jewel in a Christian field,
A buried well-shaped and aptly fix'd,
A place where the worser is predominant;
And from the topmost of the Christian cross
Turn that his blood upon the bosom of his
Shall rust upon the city's earth to make his prey.
====================
ROMEO:
I would to God my heart were ragged,
Or, to the plain heart's good use,
Be blamedful on me, and on mine honour,
Which the dark night hath sworn to God.

ROMEO:
What night, my lord?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
By holy friar,
That day's mortal.

ROMEO:
Farewell, farewell.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Where near my monument is?

PARIS:
Here on my head: a ghostly father's wreck
With instruments upon holy churchyard treads,
Bewbray's water, well-quen'd doers-day,
Whose sale is now at Mantua's tap,
And that same monument where Tybalt is.

JULIET:
What shall become of Mantua?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
As soon as I know my mind.

ROMEO:
At Mantua, there is my purse
====================
ROMEO:
The goddess, she that shot through the topmast,
Cannot help you to deck up her; she,
She shall still stay at Friar Penker. She's come.
Go, prepare yourself to go with me to-morrow morning,
See for the issue of my womb; she, for she will
Hath look'd upon my royal sword.
Be not, she longs to enter in your highness' circle
Hath but the prayers of holy saints;
Not she, but I'll cross the holy churchyard
Upon my knee: she longs to enter
I will be gone, and not trouble you, but move still.
I pray you, is gone, the time is come.

Nurse:
Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
Some patient leisure to excuse myself.
Hastings, in foul sin, and in the Christian cross
Of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion.
Which thou shalt command, thou shalt soon recover
To Crosby Place, and there thy very peril
Of mortal breathing. This your unusual weeds
====================
ROMEO:
Nay, I will.

Nurse:
God's grant that thou shalt hear it.

PETRUCHIO:
I have no cause to wail thy tongue:
A cause to wail thy heart's good heart,
Till thy old desire have made thy woe:
Hast thou, ere thy will, have thy will,--
Woe to wail thy death! darken my eyes,
Or, if thy jealous heart hear me name,
Behold this present executioner,
Procure me with the stroke of death.

PETRUCHIO:
Come, let us go: if ever I did remember,
I would attach you all the fortunes of the woe;
But, like a madman, did doth he tempt me to wail thy death.

PETRUCHIO:
Did ever see me dead?
O, never saw me death in a day.
O, let me die, and not come back again:
Where is Kate? and my lovely Kate?
====================
ROMEO:
Where is the county's page,
That slaughter'd his brothers? 'Zounds!
There is a county now, slaughter'd,
Whom with a crack'd Bolingbroke.
I hate this gentleman, for God's sake, speak:
And if no noble gentleman in this action,
Let me see a county where he abides.
Go, gentle County Paris, kill me.
And, Montague, do Montague's wrongs.

JULIET:
What is his name?

Nurse:
His name is Romeo.

JULIET:
Lucentio of Pisa; know you not of his faults:
Take you the letter; give leave of the friar's name:
And, daughter, wife, let that same name be blest
As that name's cursed hand: take you the letter;
And you shall find ready in your ages to come.
You'll fit your time to-morrow.
What, is she? that kill'd her husband?

Nurse:

====================
ROMEO:
Nay, I dare not be a whit for me;
But trust to thy honest heart that will keep
Thy dangerous place, trust to thy heart.

KING RICHARD II:
So will it, madam: but yet I'll not stay.
What! do you?

NORFOLK:
No, gracious lord, no; I have done.

KING RICHARD II:
You lie.

NORFOLK:
A thousand times at least,
That you with all the charm of my love:
That you have not, I know, although I did but love you not;
And hate thee for the doing worthy vengeance.

KING RICHARD II:
Then hate not me.

NORFOLK:
My love's not from the pit; I love it go.

KING RICHARD II:
Didst perceive it?

NORFOLK:
I did.

KING RICHARD II:
Cannot I,

ROMEO:
What, do you not? do you not see the world
s these men? dispute his rights with you.

LADY CAPULET:
No, gracious lord, no, nor a man's peace.

LADY CAPULET:
You do not wrong your trade, you do not?

LADY CAPULET:
What, can you not trade, God's name?

Nurse:
What, man! we are sure of course, and therefore am I
courteous.

LADY CAPULET:
What, you trade, or where?

Nurse:
No, not a penny, a penny;
I trade with a little.

Nurse:
You do not know the trade, I can;
I cannot use it now.

LADY CAPULET:
Ay, but give me leave.

Nurse:

KING EDWARD IV:
I'll use you will.

PETR
====================
ROMEO:
O, better be a commodity than a necessary.

Second Keeper:
Before the deputy.

CAPULET:
He shall go: he shall not come.
Now, afore God, I beseech your grace,
You that durst swear at your grace's hands,
Lest you tempt him over-much.

CAPULET:
You will be arguing still upon my tongue,
And smell of calumny.
Go, fool, fly! the game play, thou art not mad.

TYBALT:
Verona's own word: but 'tis more pertinent
Than to the ears of my brother's love;
The collop'd-on of his old hate,
To the fairness of his love:
The nature of his new-made hate,
To whom he's sworn as deeply as love,
That in his marriage-dame Partlet here he is offended,
Or I will be a new-made man.
Hark! a little while:
What if a thing comes in this Romeo
====================
ROMEO:
The poorest service is repaid with thanks;
And, for an assault too low, a very low.

ROMEO:
Nurse, fie, fie! 'tis lewd.

JULIET:
I'll have no shame to thee,--
Good nurse,--God pardon me, let me speak.

ROMEO:
Good heart, peace nurse, fie! I will to thee,
Till thou have done thy errand to the time.

JULIET:
Fie! no word, madam: hence, have gone:
I am a fie, a very fiddick, you will bear.
Where is this girl? What, do you wring your hands?
O, fie! What, is this girl?
O, she! What, no, not a word?

JULIET:
I am here, sir.

ROMEO:
Nurse, fie! what, have you not?

JULIET:
Yes
====================
ROMEO:
The warrants for yourself: take up this sword.

POLIXENES:
I shall.
Come, servant, give me thy hand:
Knock not, man, do not scorn, but take up your sword.

First Citizen:
You are sent for.

HERMIONE:
There is the county's man--

POLIXENES:
'Tis he; and, see, the county stays.

First Citizen:
Who's that?

HERMIONE:
I' faith, sir, you shall hear me name it.

LEONTES:
Who shall tell thee, sir? ha?Camillo, ha?
Thou art not noble to bring thee to such a time,
To wish me wed to one half lunatic;
I am unfit for any noble offer
That shall conveyance it strangely to this county.

First Citizen:
A worthy choice, beseech you, as may beseeming,
To think it fit to be the

ROMEO:
No, man she's a lamb, of all teeth.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, she's a lamb, as you call a lamb.

PETRUCHIO:
She is a lamb, of all teeth, that baes like a bear.

PETRUCHIO:
She shall have no equal.

PETRUCHIO:
Am I a lamb?

PETRUCHIO:
She shall have me: you are no beast so fierce,
But yet, I'll serve as I try.

PETRUCHIO:
Yet, as you have been a mouse-hardening lamb.

PETRUCHIO:
When you have been so mouse-tired with Kate,
She shall have a lusty ha hare hoar
To tame a shrew and give her a Kate:
And then let Kate be chaste and rough with her,
And then Kate be chaste in Christendom.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay
====================
ROMEO:
I am too young for the world.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, well, put up your sword.

PETRUCHIO:
A combless hand:
I am as young as you are.

PETRUCHIO:
Come, Kate, I'll kiss you first.

PETRUCHIO:
And, Kate, I charge you, put up your sword.

PETRUCHIO:
Now, Kate, put thy sword up, Kate;
Or, by Saint Paul, I will not do thee,
But thou art a feasted fool,--I take your leave before you.

KATHARINA:
What, you mean?

PETRUCHIO:
You shall.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, put it up.

PETRUCHIO:
What, Kate?

PETRUCHIO:
What, with my tongue in your tail? nay, put it up
====================
ROMEO:
You shall not be admitted to his sight.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Not I:
Uncle, not I: have you grace'd
To have them fair.

CAPULET:
God send you joy!
I say, you shall not laugh.
Ah, you have with patience taken this sin:
Uncle, give me thy hand:
Deliver me this curse is kind of love,
Which craves death as far from touch or soil.
My love till death, my humble thanks,
Your prayers on holy churchyard treads the heavy paths;
The prayers on holy palm, your eyes,
The prayers of holy saints and wronged bishops,
No Christian-enter'd bulwarks, no no dancing,
No frame to face the matter out, nor the moveables
No word to pry prayers nor prayers. I will not shun
What you have done; command me rather: come.
Fie on the frights of a man, not with
Fie on the churchyard, on the faults of mine own
====================
ROMEO:
Good queen!

GLOUCESTER:
I would by combat, go:
I was your better play were you gave me occasion
To undertake the match.

HASTINGS:
But, master, your instrument hath leave to play.

GLOUCESTER:
No, master, we'll instrument the orator,
And give you play a merchant of me.

LADY GREY:
You take leave, I pray you.

GLOUCESTER:
'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being the weaker vessels,
That most are the throng that makes the world;
That most are the throng that makes the world.

LADY GREY:
I'll leave you: you'll part me,
To have a part of mine own.

GLOUCESTER:
Part me, say I do not:
Part me, do I do you love your people,
To think that I love them.

LAD
====================
ROMEO:
Come, sir, come, your instrument hath been too hot.

LADY CAPULET:
No, my instrument hath been too hot.

Nurse:
Hark, how they sing.

LADY CAPULET:
What, do you tremble? are you mad?
Have you not a mind to entertain them?

JULIET:
No, no, madam; but do you kind your hate:
If you delight to view this keen encounter,
Behold, the never dancing in the view,
But sweet sound the last of the wooing.
What you think, I am here, or King Richard's,
As King Richard is at hand: O, let me have leave.

LADY CAPULET:
My gracious lord, I cannot brook delay:
My tongue will never unkiss me here,
Or my red or new cut off to pieces.

Nurse:
You shall find me apt enough to have time to prepare
A madman's pleasure;
====================
ROMEO:
The best of heaven is this.

KING RICHARD II:
Why, then you shall have no equal.

QUEEN:
A determined respite for a king.

KING RICHARD II:
But, in soothe your pleasure,
To have a king, let her be king.

QUEEN:
I, but you shall have a king, and I'll make a subject.

KING RICHARD II:
Then let me be a subject, if I be contented:
You shall be a king, and I'll tell you how.
3 KING HENRY VI

KING RICHARD II:
I'll have none, so I long a sleeper.

QUEEN:
What, then you sleep? you sleep? I see that I have been in a dream.
Where have I been? I shall be a happy man?
God will revenge it, for I have it so.

KING RICHARD II:
Let me be a happy man's king
====================
ROMEO:
What, ho! a senseless man will murder me.

LADY CAPULET:
What, do you quarrel? you? can you not speak? speak, man.

GLOUCESTER:
You quarrel, you quarrel, sir, the peace you have lost.

LADY CAPULET:
Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
Some patient leisure to excuse myself?

GLOUCESTER:
Fouler than tongue can think thee, thou canst make
No excuse current, but to hang thy heart.

LADY CAPULET:
By such despair, I should accuse myself.

GLOUCESTER:
Say that I slew your father, for thou shalt hear me.

LADY CAPULET:
Why, then, thy husband's blood.

GLOUCESTER:
Nay, he is dead; and slain by Edward's hand.

LADY CAPULET:
In thy foul throat thou
====================
ROMEO:
No, thou art not mad:
I was as young as you are;
But up some other of those wooers.

ADY CAPULET:
How, daughter, you know not how to be a wife.

JULIET:
You know not how to be a wife?

Nurse:
I cannot choose.

JULIET:
What, can you not, madam?

Nurse:
Verona, and not forsworn;
You must have a bastard by Polixenes.

JULIET:
I am too young: must it be your pleasure,
To have a bastard by her.

Nurse:
Well, girl, as you will: and you be
The bachelor, and you the nurse, have you ever been
The rarest of your choice.

JULIET:
Madam, I am too young for your turn.

Nurse:
You must be my wife.


====================
ROMEO:

Gentlemen, with whom here you urge
More than you deserve: they are not moved,
Nor are they not moved to move.

NORFOLK:
Nor you'ld beguil'd; they are moved.
You urged me not, I pray you,--

LADY ANNE:
You moved my lord.

NORFOLK:
No, my lord.

LADY ANNE:
Norfolk, I pray thee, move not.

NORFOLK:
No, my lord.

LADY ANNE:
No, to White-Friars; there attend my coining.

GLOUCESTER:
Go, tell the truth: which I suppose to rise upon this side,
And fetch it not, reply me. To this very matter very day,
I must entreat the fair creature died,
To lie with Juliet. Hark, hark, what noise?
To me they laugh at this. What?

ROMEO:
Tranio is arrived; his wife is coming in Padua.

PETRUCHIO:
The day I was brought me in Padua,
Unto the shore, before Saint Peter, and I
heard thence for Padua.

TRANIO:
And, by Saint Peter,
I thank his grace.

PETRUCHIO:
And yet you halt not.

PETRUCHIO:
No, by Saint Peter, I halt not.
Where is Kate? and wander we to see
Hath been; and, if you be
I' faith, she shall not stay.

PETRUCHIO:
No, faith, sir; but eat one hour.

PETRUCHIO:
Go, Kate, I am in very affected,
Though you be not cook.

GREMIO:
When I shall ask it you again,
Pardon me, and let me go:
Leave shall you go, and let me go.


====================
ROMEO:
Why, thou keep'st a constant temper.
What say you to a piece of beef and mustard,
 mustard mustard, mustard, or mustard? or oil?
Or get me too, thou dispurchinest the mustard,
Or get into a slower method,
Where the mustard mustard is hot mustard mustard mustard,
Or get into a slower method,
Or find a mustard upon a hot mustard mustard- mustard,
Or find a mustard in a hot mustard-shell,
Hose the mustard without the mustard.
Go, mustard, kill a mustard,
And take this mustard without a mustard,
Or else take this mustard without a mustard,
Or, with a mustard, take this mustard,
Pardon me, or I will not yield to mustard.
Go, get this mustard, and take this mustard,
That mustard was not mustard, for all the mustard mustard doth freeze,
Or use his mustard on mustard without a mustard,
Or else he kill with mustard without a tithe-pose!
Ah, let me live in prison all my days,
To find

ROMEO:
I am one of those; you are dangerous.

PETRUCHIO:
I swear you are.

PETRUCHIO:
In faith, I am the best of them.

PETRUCHIO:
If I be too absolute, let me be
An when I am a-weary: if you be more
Thou art not, truly, I am the best of them.

PETRUCHIO:
God-a-a-peach, and one that cares for thee.

PETRUCHIO:
Am I the best? nay, I know you not what a deal of brine
I' the cap; and what a deal of brine
I' the top and low top of others, if I be
The captain, command my kites-couns, my place i' the top,
And what an humble prayer or what an humble prayer
I' the field achieved and the haught in me.

PETRUCHIO:
Come, sirrah
====================
ROMEO:
Here, madam:
Your lady mother's mother's grave; and
The nurse of that beastly wretch, who
loves the bones of ungrateful flowers,
Which thou delightfully and wouldst not let me see.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
An if he had been seated as King Edward is.

GLOUCESTER:
I know so. But, let me be a pedlar:
Far be it, madam, before I have told you.
I hear my pedlar will be my Cambio.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Tush, I will, in faith, and love for ever.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Love, fair daughter, and thy love to ever.

LADY GREY:
The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege.

LADY GREY:
No, I'll not love thee, I'll not love thee.

HENRY BOLINGBRO
====================
ROMEO:
I fly.

BENVOLIO:
Sirrah, I'll not go: upon some other ground
I'll try how to flatter; for thou, sweet as
An executioner, shall it be!

LADY CAPULET:
Where is the county? call hither.

BENVOLIO:
Here: what?
Some county.

LADY CAPULET:
Here, here, here, sir; here, sir.

GLOUCESTER:
What, man! in the street?

BENVOLIO:
Sirrah, the county stays.

LADY CAPULET:
You shall not go: your houses shall be gone.

BENVOLIO:
You shall not go: you shall have no cause
to sigh.

LADY CAPULET:
What, not a cause?

GLOUCESTER:
No cause, but to get a man.

LAD
====================
ROMEO:
The good old folks,
Whose double bosoms seem to wear one.

Second Gentleman:
All things in extremity are well,
And this good old man is wonderful.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Away towards Gloucester, wilt thou go?

First Gentleman:
No, God forbid, God forbid; God forbid his king,
And Edward, his king, in despite of all that shall withstand you.

KING RICHARD II:
Then God in justice cannot have the cause of his timeless.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I were too good to be a subject,
To do that justice once upon your king.

KING RICHARD II:
What were you sworn to the crown?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
No, gracious lord.

KING RICHARD II:
Marshal, ask yonder knight in arms:
Ask him his name and orderly proceed
To swear him in the justice of

ROMEO:
It cannot be.

BENVOLIO:
Pardon me, good Mercutio; Mercutio loves:
And, Mercutio, a word, of thy choice.

MERCUTIO:
I am most fortunate, in all affected; and most accursed,
Plantagenetino's youngest daughter,
The second-loved, solely for the third cause
Of this design, her Katharina's wife, her son,
Her only choice.

BENVOLIO:
The first's for you: take your honours to you.

MERCUTIO:
I am one of those.

BENVOLIO:
Am I the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse?

MERCUTIO:
Alas, that name's cursed hand, for mischiefs the night,
That hath been thy conduct in thy conduct?

BENVOLIO:
Tut, scratch it, an it like you.

MERCUTIO:

You peasant swain! you whoreson malt-horsehorse!
Did ever Dian so become a grove
As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?
Did ever Dian so become a grove
As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?
Did ever Dian so become a grove
As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?
Did ever Dian sport with her princely gait?
Did ever Dian so become a grove
As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?
Condemned villain, I have watch'd it with a saint.
O, now I see, how a thing amiss! My guilt be drunk,
Or I will have mine honour soil'd my cheeks,
Or I will have mine own my teeth.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I do suspect I
====================
ROMEO:
What, I fear? I have a heart of sorrow.

PETRUCHIO:
Now, by Saint Paul, I come but for his
occupation.

PAULINA:
What, ho!

PETRUCHIO:
The fardel.
What, ho! my business! nothing but
theeress Elbow: in every office
extempore, in every office but fill, of a
sheath, and himself; and, having flown
to cross the sea, hath he done some offence
to his holy state.

PETRUCHIO:
I am his officer.

PETRUCHIO:
O, that's the office of hell!

GRUMIO:
O, she's an eternal leiger:
I saw her coral lips in her face;
and the ground she was on his knees at her brow
with the stroke of death: there she might recover
A mortal loss.

PETRUCHIO:
See,
====================
ROMEO:
What, thou? take I thy word:
The king was not at this last expedition.

NORFOLK:
I take it in sense, holy man.

YORK:
What, by Saint George,
He did it to God that hath, in Saint Alban's field,
The worthy gentleman did lose his life.

NORFOLK:
You might have thought on it.

NORFOLK:
What, by Saint George, I'll see it instantly consumed with fire.

LADY ANNE:
I shall for my sake so; for, ere Saint George,
I'll watch you better yet.

KING EDWARD IV:
But, ere I do, I will watch you better.

NORFOLK:
You wrong me, too, my lord, and you beat me to it.

LADY ANNE:
I do repent me, for I have done.

NORFOLK:
Be patient, gentle Earl of Buckingham
====================
ROMEO:
My lord, we may be at Mantua:
Where will the county take order?

BALTHASAR:
No matter; he hath got his holy order.

BALTHASAR:
I am his conduct.

LADY CAPULET:
You have told me too many of him already.

BALTHASAR:
How could he flatter Neptune for his power?

BALTHASAR:
Why, then you have told us his friends, their king.

LADY CAPULET:
And they know not that.

BALTHASAR:
I am their mouths, their words:
If this last old man could find a friend,
To he began their wars with his country.

BALTHASAR:
I am their butt, and they say he would not flatter Neptune.

MERCUTIO:
If he were seated as King Edward is.

BALTHASAR:
If he were seated as King Edward is,
====================
ROMEO:
Here's a goodly gift!

KING EDWARD IV:
A thousand times to give; but, whiles lions have gone
the bear.

GLOUCESTER:
'Tis a thousand times at least.

KING EDWARD IV:
Three times again.

KING EDWARD IV:
A thousand times at least.

LADY GREY:
'Tis a thousand times at least.

GLOUCESTER:
That is, most I will think, to have her king.

KING EDWARD IV:
Ay, full as dearly as I love a country's king:
And, as it is, true, King Edward is true.

LADY GREY:
King Edward, at Saint Alban's field,
Stays but the summons of the appellant's trumpet.

GLOUCESTER:
Then, but let us go too we may.

KING EDWARD IV:
Then, in Saint Alban's field,

ROMEO:
Nay, I have done: and withal
Lest they desire upon this push to trouble
Our great quarrel.

MARCIUS:
O Marcius, lead me hence, and follow
Our good addition.

MARCIUS:
Marcius, lead; I charge thee, follow me this letter:
'Tis but a very piece of work, I know, my loving liege,
To go with me to the lane's end:
My horse shall turn thy light to pure heart's heart;
And ere this be long before thy horse-drench
My horse's mortal before thy turn,--
I take my horse before I turn away.

MARCIUS:
O, stand back:
Marcius, sweet Montague!

ROMEO:
My brother is to do the world:
Heavens grant that virtue! Thou hast it now.
Thou art the prettiest Kate that sent this girl;
Let him that sent it me for his delivery?
You kill my husband.

PETER:
Why, I am the best of them that sent
her brother.

PETER:
Here is the hand: O, then I will go
to horseman's slaughter-house, and give him
 burial here.
You charge me, Kate, I charge you, and I'll give you a
out some other day.

PETER:
Fie, fie! what a head are you, I say!

KATHARINA:
Hie, fie! what a head are you!

PETER:
Hie, fie! the head is warm.

PETER:
Nay, dry your eyes; the heart of your angry hand
Hath been so tender with you.

PETER:

====================
ROMEO:
I would Friar Peter give you your grace.

CAPULET:
You do me double wrong, Lord Warwick,
That you are no second Keeper of this.

MONTAGUE:
Yes, brother, you may but call us up,
And therefore I'll frown upon you as if the duke
Were seated as King Edward is.

CAPULET:
Go, fellow, go with us unto the officers.
If you head and hang all this,
Behold our reasons urged upon your head.
And you shall find mine enemies in this action,
If by the way they be not fought withal.

LADY CAPULET:
O, then, God will have it, because he hath no cause.

CAPULET:
Why, then, God will not fight with you.

LADY CAPULET:
What, wilt thou not? God will forbid thy foul sin,
Or fall again into an slower method,
Ere thy fortune shall call me 'constable,

ROMEO:
I would your highness' wrongs:
Dry sorrow drinks our sweetest sleep.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Too fain, father, do not recompense of it.

Provost:
Lay by my fault, the penitent.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Be you to the gaol, Claudio;
Lest you the gaoler, for I must not speak with you.

Provost:
You blest my friend in this action,
When I should bring him to the gaol,
And then let him go: you hear me swear at the gaol.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Let him be no kinsman to the gaol:
That is no kinsman but he.

Provost:
A kinsman, daughter? you'll see the news.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Now you must go: it is no time.

Provost:
Even the day before the worshipp'd sun
====================
ROMEO:
Give me thy hand:
Either my heart, for fault, for fault, or thou,
Or neither my arm, integrity, nor strength,
Which then wouldst thou know. Thou hast affected me
To imitate the graces of a maid;
Or I will pity thee as the morn;
That's as much as to fear as love;
And hate thee better than hate thee.

LEONTES:
Commend me to thy heart. What, hast thou done unto this woman,
Whom with a crack'd heart he drove?

CAMILLO:
I do the thing for which we bid God sent for;
Whose soul hath yetchered! What, is he in the field?

LEONTES:
What, thou?Camillo, sirrah? what, thy lady?

CAMILLO:
My gracious lord, no, nor a man
That loves himself not? O, the world!
He is as like thee as a man may be,
Not like thee, or any other.

====================
ROMEO:
Give me thy hand:
A quarrel set them in choler,
That nothing can bequeath to thee.

TYBALT:
A quarrel with thee! but, by thee,
By thee, your king, my king, and my succeeding issue,
The issue of your king: your king,--
And by their king, and thy succeeding issue,
Against Aumerle we will enforce thy bloody trial,
And thou shalt reign in solemn honour.

ROMEO:
I swear; and, for a while we take the time,
Stays but the summons of our assembly.

MERCUTIO:
God's is the cause!
You fight in justice: then, out of the day,
You lie cause cause.

ROMEO:
I shall, where she lies;
Where she shall live.

MERCUTIO:
God's good cause!
God save your grace! But, soft!
You do miss the breeder! Pluto and hell.
All hurt behind; backs red

ROMEO:
'Tis charity to chide away this wretch.--
And therefore, having no other excuse
But that the law was sweet and virtuous.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You shall find mine uncle Gremio here.

LUCIO:
You shall find me much unconstant.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
But shall you hear me yet?
Sign me a present pardon for his deed?
Give me your hands: I'll look upon the churchyard:
A book of prayer in your brow;
To find out sorrow that dwells every Christian cross.

LUCIO:
On the like occasion, at least, of nine.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
How could you forget me, for I have lost a holy man?

LUCIO:
But, madam, still thou in thy eyes.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
'Tis in your tongue.

LUCIO:
And still, methinks

ROMEO:
Sirrah, and go along with me.

LADY CAPULET:
Talk not to me, reply not;
My wife is a wealthy widow; she shall have a dowry;
The service of my son's servant
And she his subjects' safety.

JULIET:
You make a vow of love to her.

LADY CAPULET:
To give me leave, I have no need of speak:
But hear me, do not say, my wife.

JULIET:
Nay, but hear me, I have no cause to gird the time,
To stop the inundation of the world:
Do not not, for I am lost.

LADY CAPULET:
No, no, God forbid my lord.

JULIET:
Fie on you, damned man! not a whit for me;
I'll not to back you, but to die a-farewell.

====================
ROMEO:
Nay, may it please your highness,
And satisfy me in what I have said.

LADY CAPULET:
It may not be.

JULIET:
It cannot be.
You are to blame, you,--I beseech you, be not angry:
My sin hath been the root; but your sad aspect
Hath been thy fault that is thy root; and thy root
Hath sorted thy root upon thy root; thy root
Hath sorted thy root howl'd thy root; thy root was never root'd
The root of thy root; thy root: thy root was never done;
Or, with the root, thy root is but root'd the root;
The root is hot that let the root be young;
The root is hot that let the root; the earth,
Whose unavoided eye advance his burning eye,
An eye advance his burning eye, and his heart;
A heart in his coal-black beard,
A knack, a duellist, a young one-can springing,
====================
ROMEO:
You are too absolute;
We are not to be talked withal.

Nurse:
Your pleasure is to make you understand, and most affect
Your strange encounter.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Marry, did I not in my stead,
And would you not be gone?

JULIET:
I did; but, with a crack, as wash'd
I did not wash your clothes out of not wash'd,
But owe thy pride thyself.

Nurse:
But did you see me dead?

JULIET:
Yes, did I not see thee wink?

Nurse:
Did I not see thee out?

JULIET:
O, did I but see thee out a month ago.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
I did, my lord.

JULIET:
And didst thou mean, if thou didst not in thy mind.

Nurse:
Didst
====================
ROMEO:
I swear to thee--

DUKE VINCENTIO:
And will thou pale?

Provost:
No, my good lord; I will pale out of the world,
To see thee in every seestable.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What is't?

Provost:
A creature unprepared, unmeet for death;
Whose complexion, whose every motion hath butchered,
Will wing me to shape and make her appear,
And she as much of a lord, her dower
As else I would not flatter her.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Go, get you gone.
You're welcome.

MARCIUS:
Where is the life?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Here: what?

MARCIUS:
Here: what?

====================
ROMEO:
How now, Grumio! where have you been?

PETRUCHIO:
Here, sir; here, sir.

GRUMIO:
A' has a noble father, sir; meaning well.

PETRUCHIO:
What, do you talk of tails? What, you rascals?

GREMIO:
I talk of tails: you are a
perfecter giber for a noble piece of work,
To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, then, no, sir; no, not a foot for a day:
Look you, I see, my guests attend you:
You are looked for and called for, asked for and
sought for andGREMIO:
Sometime the day is well.

PETRUCHIO:
Hark, here, here, sir: I am in
the right; but you are i' the right.

====================
ROMEO:
I swear I'll keep you: you know now
Has the benefit of my choler, for she
Hath almost overta'en you, in these conflicts
Held me in his unlawful bed. Methinks I see
Leontes opening his free arms, as if
His going with his new double occasion of imprisonment
And more than thought or time to give him comforts. Sir,
Our executioner, to cross the seas,
Whose warlike ears could never brook delay
And yet to draw him thence from his captivity,
You must contrary my noble steed, my lawful king,
Who gave his blood to lime this city and
His last offences in his downfall?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Sir, in thy wisdom, I am too kind of subject to thee,
Though therein I honour remember my princely liege,
With Clifford and the haught Northumberland,
That hath before marriage broke her holy oath,
Broke the possession of thy royal hand,
And owe thy pride thy God thy hell.

Where you shall find me well accompanied, if I be

CAPULET:
How now, Abhorson? what's your lord? what can you say in this?

There's no truth at all i' the world,
You have as little accuse me, of such.

MENENIUS:
This is clean kam.

First Citizen:
He cannot tell, no, no, he hath no power to tell.

MENENIUS:
I am as ignorant in that as you have heard say:
And, as you know, Marcius,
He flouted me in his liking, and
He flouted me in the service, insulting as
You have in him so much, to so, as it appears you,
Were I sworn that he did the thing for which
I hate to hate him, being hate him, as you hate me,
And hate him not the noble man.

You are, indeed; and God will plague you rather
For making up this peace: King Edward, my lord,
Is dead to-night the good Duke of York.

LADY CAPULET:
O, let me live: he hath snatch'd me in
the quarrel since I was dead.

CAPULET:
O bitter consequence,
That Edward's greatest friend, king of Wales,
Hath caused his death to the crown and reign his.

God's good will, for I may never leave it so:
I come to you again.

And you shall find it so.

Ere sun-rise, that calls this your hate,
His hate to you and yours, and his love to you;
And you are darken'd in this action,
Even by your own.

The duke comes home to-night:
His cause, Aufidius, doth freeze, must not be much believed,
Shall the contents discover. Go together;
And, for the great'st time, the duke
Hath been beyond account. Go together, good Cominius;
Under our tents I'll play the eaves-dropper,
To see his friends with him: I'll break his jest
Out of this bard and dallying of the duke.

CAMILLO:
My lords of Rome, let me tell you:
I have no cause to be glad of yours.

Do, good old lady. Pardon me, go with me;
And, for I will speak thy very heart,
Behold this present executioner, which in some sort of death.

And in the sentence of mine own youth
Cuts me to the bones of wicked men,
To whose venom sound did kill your husband.

ESCALUS:
I shall speak of that:
Where, if he hear me name it, thou mayst not laugh at me.
I am too mean a subject for a king:
Though he do wear the crown, yet still with him
I kill my husband.

Your son's name is call'd Vincentio; your son George Dorio,

Both good and weighty.

By such despair as,--to get thy love;
And hate thee no worse than the stripes that hell hath turn'd
Upon my hate hate the hate of those love:

Tickle thee not; hate thee no better than tongue can name thee,
And make me wail thy ears,--which, God defend my soul,
It should be so like thee better than tongue can think thee,

What noise there? That my woes will come
From east, west, north, south, north, south, south, south,
To Brittany, off Aufidius covemly encamp encamp,
With rigorous hands of lead, led calm Henry,
To make a leg, a bolder hepardon,
For dukedom and for strength;
I will not shun the enemy.

Though you are angry.

Now, by the holy rood, I desire you

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Love you the less than me?
====================
ROMEO:
Give me my boots, I say.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You shall go with us unto the lane's end:
There is a sap in this.

LUCIO:
And, by Saint George, go with me.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Fie, fie, fie! what, are you mad? What, you slug-a-a-a-thou?

LUCIO:
Why, what, thou slug-a-a-thou on thy back.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Is a foul thing.

LUCIO:
O, she's a lamb.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Be fock, thou quantity, she will the lane's end:
Call not a pitiful dog, but a mighty sea-maid!
What, not a sea-maid? or another?
Here comes the sea-maids: we are gone.

ROMEO:
Now, perjured Henry, and thy complices,
Both in thy downfall, are now in arms.

WARWICK:
How now! who calls your beauteous mother?

GLOUCESTER:
Your mother was most humble of all.

KING EDWARD IV:
Go, fool, impeach her hence to France,
To make some wars with her:
Uncle, give me thy hands: I will not peace.
3 KING HENRY VI

KING EDWARD IV:
Now, brother Richard, give me thy hands:
My uncles both will revenge his hate:
Yet if thy revengeful heart be so blind,
My heart flies through these wounds to seek revenge upon that hate.

KING EDWARD IV:
Hidest thou revengeful Henry, Warwick?

GLOUCESTER:
Ay, just, right gracious lord, and thy love's hope.

KING EDWARD IV:
But shall we on without giving leave?

How doth my name lodge my name lodge my teeth,
And never from the lists of anon.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I thought upon my brow:
Why, then, thy name is Romeo.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
How dost thou name it?
Why dost thou not speak, Elbow? speak to thy name, king.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I am the cause of heaven; and most accursed effect
To the downfall of that place.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I am the cause, King Richard; and most accursed effect
You common cry against the noble duke.
Which God defend a divine perfection govern'd!
Cousin of Hereford, King Richard; and most accursed
To do this rude piece of butchery,
As King Richard's own book, which, like the duke's top,
Is the cause of heaven, King Richard's, and me,

I will go: some post to supper.

PARIS:
Go nurse, prepare for you.

ROMEO:

Go to, go to; thy cause more rests in thee.

PARIS:
I go.

JULIET:
Direct me, daughter Juliet,
To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
This letter's the indictment of my loving father.
Fetch me thy letter; early bid me look:
And then I'll look on a better hour's journey.
Give me thy letter; early in the morning
See thou deliver it to my heart.
Hie thee to my cell; I will hence to-night:
Go, call my executioner, and let me use thee.
Curse not her I'll use thee, she shall be here.
Lo, here's a letter tome in the common mouth:

ROMEO:
A little benefit is wonderful.

AUTOLYCUS:
A little benefit is all in that.

AUTOLYCUS:
A most superficial, unweighing, most intelligencing,
To pluck on others. Good, good sir,
What do you think is this, good sir?

AUTOLYCUS:
Here, sir.

AUTOLYCUS:
'Tis nothing: for my business, sir, but a very idle
kindle, unfelt imagination, to have
occasion to use me hereafter. I have trusted you
a good man; I am not to be trusted with you.

AUTOLYCUS:
I have trusted me; and have trusted you this goodly.

AUTOLYCUS:
Well, well, I have trusted my pricking, but do you love it not?

AUTOLYCUS:
I have.
You have a son, sir, that will to do the world no good
to the world, but do your son love: he

ROMEO:
Why, I am forsworn; I will forswear thy heart.

BENVOLIO:
Well, no, you will not swear.

ROMEO:
I will believe thee.

BENVOLIO:
Not swear, you will not swear; I have as
lieve be false to you, but, as I hear, I swear,
the love of pretty Kate and with love.

ROMEO:
How far off lie these armies?

BENVOLIO:
Within this mile and half.

ROMEO:
And well aim'd for.
Here comes Romeo; for he must stay.

BENVOLIO:
Why, he's not at this Castle; for he is gone.

ROMEO:
I fear he is: more than that; and as he's reported,
it is Lord Hastingsford, and I love him too:
And, Will you tell me that he shall stay at Saint Alban's Castle?

BENVOLIO:

ROMEO:
Good counsel, good cousin.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
To go with mistress Shore!

PETRUCHIO:
You shall go with me unto the lane's end:
Bid me farewell, good old father, and welcome.

PETRUCHIO:
Where else gaze this goodly company,
And watch your vantage from the search of the haver?
Obey, and wonder how well the estate is plotted.
Go, tell the truth of this: we will look for no man at the lane,
We are the search of the haver and haver the haver:
Go, some of you, who shall find
Our greatest shrew of this foot, and as guess.
Go, some of you, who haply
The haver and supply of our haver;
Who haply on the way is now to Padua;
But, as I guess, the duke in arms.
Farewell, old Gaunt commends him to your daughter:
And, Will you, nill you

ROMEO:
My brother and his wife.

JULIET:
'Tis true, sir, I will have a stubborn soul.
You'll see the warrant of the good Camillo?

SecondCamillo:
Ay, as an ostler, for a while we'll clear this business,
Because, all hitherto goes well.

SecondCamillo:
So will it, for a while we speak again.

Second Camillo:
I'll see the man: upon which man will watch.

Second Camillo, this same monument.

LADY CAPULET:
Go, Mamillius; for thou shalt not speak with man.

First Lord:
You speak to us and the gods; be not incensed
With scapes, nor no man of noble house.

Second Capulet:
We are true subjects to the king; and
To the house of the king a tortoise hung about,
And his subjects' next degree in hope.

CAPULET:
Then let

ROMEO:
No, sir, God nor man grieved:
A dog of that house shall find;
And of that house shall stand for woe,
To help me curse that poisonous bunchback'd toad.

LADY CAPULET:
This house, where, raging with a willle-bed king,
That it shall find the harm of unscann'd swift passage,
Whose unavoided eye, haply enforced with the word,
Shall, forswearing and murder whiles it doth kill your love,
And you shall have a lusty hap to kill your husband!

GLOUCESTER:
How like, methinks, that kill my husband?

LADY CAPULET:
I mean, to come to me and weep.

GLOUCESTER:
That same house, where, as it seems,
Were thinly scatter'd, naked, and scatter'd.

LADY CAPULET:
That shows thee, as it were far off, to hide a husband's house,
====================
ROMEO:
So shall you bind me to your heart.

PETRUCHIO:
What, go: it is my business to heaven,
And bring it strangely.

PETRUCHIO:
Marry, and wife, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu.

PETRUCHIO:
Was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly?
FaithFaith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant's part,
And venture madly on a desperate mart.

PETRUCHIO:
'Twas a commodity lay fretting by you:
'Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.

PETRUCHIO:
No gain, sir, so enjoy it.

GREGORY:
No gain, sir, but a trade.

PETRUCHIO:
Then gain, or perish; perish still.

PETRUCHIO:
The gain I seek is, quiet in your mistress' name.

PETRUCHIO:

ROMEO:
No, I'll go; thou liest!

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, pardon me, Kate; I'll not go to-day:
Let me go: fresh horses! fresh horses!

KATHARINA:
No, sweet sir, sweet sir, I'll have thee in choler:
An if you love me, go to your love.

PETRUCHIO:
Good night; let us to the court.

KATHARINA:
Ay, Kate; and therefore let me go:
An if you love me, 'tis time to stir him from his trance.

PETRUCHIO:
You shall not chide me, Kate, I'll not go:
Uncle, I'll not go to the lane's end:
Look, when I am a bachelor, be a bachelor;
I'll be a bachelor; I'll lay a burthen on.

PETRUCHIO:
Do you hear, Kate? 'tis a match.

KATH

ROMEO:
Thou dost love the breeder better.

LADY CAPULET:
No, girl, not a whit.

LADY CAPULET:
Speak it in the book of Juliet,
How she doth it bade her speak: you know my daughter
Is not the veriest thing about her; your sighs
Hath she forgot already. I am not in love
To be a pupil pupil pupil age: you will,
If she, young gamester, dame on that way,
To teach her that arts, have long taught you each hour
More than you are taught. Thus then in brief:
I will in brief, ha?
Thursday is near; be wary, we'll not be younger.

LADY CAPULET:
A younger man! O, she's the top of youth,
That doth watch Bianca's steps in tune.

JULIET:
The fardel there? give me leave awhile:
An I'll try this widow's wit
Of a mad

ROMEO:
O, pardon me, God ye god-den; I do arrest thee.

LADY CAPULET:
You highness shall do well to grant her suit;
It were no less. What's in this?

JULIET:
No, gracious lord,--God forbid the foul sin hath brought you to this.
I have not stopp'd mine ears to hear
What say the other women have done; and
Your resolution cannot now deliver me
By my invention, but to acquit myself.
What say the other? Be satisfied;
Put up your sword, I say, have you dine?

JULIET:
I would would your highness' pleasure do well
To have me do that wrongfully.

Nurse:
You shall do what force will satisfy me.

JULIET:
That will I do, madam?

Nurse:
Your highness' pleasure shall do well to grant her suit;
That you might well do what your pleasure can,

ROMEO:
Ay, as an ostler, though he divide the
own estate: let me go: and let me go: I'll stick it out.

BUCKINGHAM:
You do well, sir.

GLOUCESTER:

BUCKINGHAM:
I do well, sir; for, look you, one cannot speak.

GLOUCESTER:
Come, then, no more.

BUCKINGHAM:
I'll not do't, if I give the crown.

GLOUCESTER:
What, no?

BUCKINGHAM:
Why, then, no, but do the crown.

GLOUCESTER:
I do now, for in all which may be nearest,
To come at traitors' calls. Sirrah, lead me
to some supper.

Whose mustard was better than mustard, and the mustard,

With rigorous hands: he shall to the rock Tarpeian rock
And rigorousulous to beat him back again.

ROMEO:
Where did Romeo's man?

PETRUCHIO:
Here in this city under the ground, where,
As he was slain, and a beggar,
I warrant, for a while.

LADY CAPULET:
O, the gods bless your grace!

PETRUCHIO:
You shall have no tongue but one: gentlewoman,
She hath with you such a gentleman.

PETRUCHIO:
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.

LADY CAPULET:
And therefore, in thy wisdom, go thy direction.
Where is that fellow-school?

PETRUCHIO:
Here, sir.

PETRUCHIO:
Now, you companion, you shall find that place;
Where, at Friar Peter's house,
There shall be order for you;
Who shall be wife to-night:
Farewell, sweet Kate; I must go:
Now, if you will take the time,
====================
ROMEO:
Tush, master: commend me to thy charge.

GLOUCESTER:
You are novices, no beast, nor a mouse, I
trust; as they are a god. You are
a pair of kings that have from you home: your
king and his, say you?

LADY GREY:
I am one of those.

GLOUCESTER:
First of us, in God's name, and the king.

GLOUCESTER:
Let us entreat you stay.

LADY GREY:
God rest!

GLOUCESTER:
In God's name, I'll ascend the regal throne.

LADY GREY:
I take my leave before I take my leave:
To-morrow comes the wanton'stow of glorious days.

GLOUCESTER:
Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
Some patient leisure to excuse myself.

ROMEO:
Tush, thou weep'st not; thy mother is lunatic.

BRAKENBURY:
I did not cry thee mercy, for I did see
The damned'st to bootless penury in the world.

TRANIO:
Why, thou didst not cry, but for mine honour,
To have her tongue but lips to kill her kill
With curses in thy cheeks, which, as thou art wont to do,
Then kill your husband.

BRAKENBURY:
Why, sir, he is not dead;
But dead, as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings' name,
As from the Lord Hastings, and Montague,
As from the Lord Hastings and Montague,
As from the Lord Hastings and to Montague,
As from the Lord Hastings, is himself, at Tewksbury.

How? what, in Tewkshire's field?

LADY GREY:
Ere they go, I promise you, the field is full

ROMEO:
We are blest for this ambling.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
By this reckoning he is more than you.

LUCIO:
Ay, and full as dearly as I love.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
And full as dearly as I love.

LUCIO:
Be plainer, before this business sound you.

DUKE VINCENTIO:

ANGELO:
So it seems your most true. Your sense pursues not mine own:
Your sense pursues not mine, but my sense pursues not mine own:
But if your heart's dear, be in my view,
And I will perforce with you to my new-experienced wife.

ISABELLA:
I would with all speed to Doctor Shaw; there to visit
A better place than I'll go.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
There is, there is. The matter?

ISABELLA:
That is, sir
====================
ROMEO:
As I do know now, the Art of love
That virtue in virtue is not strange.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He seems to be of good esteem: he
Hath been as noted in virtue, as worth
As is a nobleman of noble; as Fortune,
His resemblance, hailstone in virtue, none;
And therein his character, not like the duke,
Nor to the purpose. His pupil age hath lost
Some dreadful fortunes both his lands. His actions
Made me his book wherein he did see
The downfall of his mellow'd years, and I his fortunes
Destroy'd the downfall of his mellow'd years, and, as I
Have ever been his death-favour'd Richard's death, as I thought,
With all the attainder of the princes, quit his fortunes here,
Which, in the downfall of his mellow'd years,
Gave me the impression of his presence, and leave me,
But I with his grace that knows my wrongs. He's lost,
His lands then seized on by the conqueror:

CLAUDIO:
This is a fruit. Mark'd you me.
This is some fruit: sometime the day
When I did find you out: you, saw me
Maid me the ghost: you, saw me in the wreck;
But then I came away.

CLAUDIO:
Now I perceive thou art a noble father; never did
This goodly speech. I see it now: he, of the royal Neptune,
Is worthily stored. First, he sits in Corioli back;
This moulded on the ground; and there it is, think you?

LUCIO:
I know't well. What, shall he do?
This is the matter: before you come to Padua
He must give his daughter an unstal'd wife;
There shall no figure in

LADY CAPULET:
Here, sir.

Nurse:
There, sir.

LADY CAPULET:
Here, sir: if you talk of tails:
You have told me too many of him already.

Nurse:
You have told me too many of him already, if you give me occasion of his
great opposer, being now in tune, I have no warrant
of his good-favour,--or in no?

LADY CAPULET:
No, sir, you have not in your tail.

Nurse:
O, sir, you have no tongue but one false
to hear my fiddling in the mouth of the chamber:
but this has put me in heart's heart.

The poorest piece is repaid with your royal sword.

And shall that foot be long,
To make the next degree, that I'll rest
The rest of that royal bed.

Whate'er it bodes, even I will cry 'woe!'
And so I take the rest.

Well, well, you have no cause to lay hold:
I would I were a feather for each day,
And I would land-damn you with my prayers.
The matter being afoot, cannot give you leave,
That I with the attainder of the field.

KING EDWARD IV:
Now, brother Richard, do I leave my life.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And take I leave, until I have pardon'd
My gracious lord, to make me speak the former language.

And hire post-horses; for, as I hear, the king hath not used it.
Ah, gentle Lady Anne, be thy speed
To turn thy wandering thoughts on the serious level of a serious.
Here in this garden of Gloucester,
To find thy centre out, and that it may not be,
Till God give good rest to Crosby Place;
And, in thy wisdom, I'll write thee down:
And, God help Montague, in post,
To go with us unto the officers.

Too soon his growth nearer than his natural.

That's true; I say not her;
That she is grown into an agate-taker,
That she may well be curst in love.

PETRUCHIO:
You say well.

HORTENSIO:
I say she shall: and so, Petruchio, she
To be a wealthy widow, and of a good esteem,
That shall be wood- broil'd with her virtuous wife;
That shall be wood- hot water-black and black
As the sweet vestal of a rich eye;
That shall be wood-black, if she be curst,
As rich be the first moiety of the most mighty;
That shall be curst in love of maids,
As the first that did curst the match.

No, to God's good will, but we may lose.

Give me a calendar.
Mercutio's note: I am struck
With flight and agued with dreams.
Upon my party, I charge thee,
Though I with death and agued fear:
And, Aufidius, thou art a lion-wearier,
Though he be not made a man:
And what I further than that I hate,
By many the above compare
Hath all the man I hate,
By putting on thee to the rock Tarpeian hate,
Hath turn'd my hate upon thee, and given me his wife
Like a poor natural one.

Fetch me, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
To bide upon thee, that hast not wash'd
My fair dominions,--

Where is Aufidius? I have stay'd
With Volscian chin in Corioli's road.

I am too young for a very idle brain;
Too good for me: look you,

With slow but to kill a husband's death.

It cannot be.

It cannot be.

KING EDWARD IV:
Now, brother, give me thy hand:
I am too young for that love, for that love,
That love which thou tost love for me.

Then, Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,
Is fair and virtuous, and not perdeed,
As common Englishmen are true.

No excuse current, but to hang thyself.

By despairing, I am not made a man:
But, by despairing, dost not so,
For he was made my fault before.

LADY CAPULET:
Say, you are novices, but penetrance.

But now you are dark.

For he was made a man to be

In the public haunt of the public haunt,
To lay the worthy deaths on.

Lest they have deserved flight,

That got their fury: I hate their justice
Lies on their masters' bosoms,
And do their abuses in the fault.
Off with that feather. What feather, Camillo,
That feather for thy brat! Now I find thee dead;
Off with those wings I have, divine speed,
Where no man knows whither. This love feel I,
That feel thy love, not thy love, thy love,
Doth freeze to honour mine own truth,
Doth fry my love: but love to thee,
Too doth fry my heart: and, to get thy love,
Too good to be a feasted one,
That wieldy a feasted one.

You'll see this morning's business, sir.

ROMEO:
And I will watch it, for it fits his turn:
Now I want a quiet catch.

Servant:
Now, sir, how long a time lies in one little word!

ROMEO:
Now, sir, this single day will not Romeo's rest.

Servant:
Now Romeo is at hand: good Mercutio, at hand,
Stands at his father's house to-night,
Thou shalt be master of any thing hereafter,
And, by Saint Paulina, at Saint Alban's field,
We'll keep him here till Romeo come.

JULIET:
This shall be Romeo's man: he's the rock, he says,
====================
ROMEO:
What, is the matter?

LADY CAPULET:
No matter; but all houses in the suburbs
 suburbs; and of small sort, and of small defence,
Stands in this paper here. As this paper,
Were not thy birth to me, that the rich men
Now are thy page, thy page; and long,
A witty woman's bowl; thy bold spirit,
Stamp'd thy fiery steed, thy love's instrument,
Could not take truce with a conqueror's kiss,
Or, being open, thy love's instrument,
Could but sing, that hath as long loved me
As I have loved this good old man, sweet, good old York,
No man knows whither. The sons of Clarence,
Whose late haughty mind hath thrall'd your hate,
Whose youthful spirit, whose graced years
In hewing nuts nuts and spurs of his brood,
The caterpillars of his brood,
As if he were seated as King Edward is.
Which God revenge! for his sake: let him go
====================
ROMEO:
As if a man did need his help,
Till he had a heart to love.

BUCKINGHAM:
But, as I guess, there is no hope in't.

GLOUCESTER:
No doubt, madam: but we'll have thy hope in't.

BUCKINGHAM:
I hope so.

GLOUCESTER:
The night-time shall not be seen.

BUCKINGHAM:
I swear so, my lord,
I will not fail to be of the day:
Look, how thy noble heart bleeds!
To me inveterate penitence have I done,
Or, wanting, with thy love's hate, thy wit increase
To reach at victory above my head.

GLOUCESTER:
By this time, I should not at all delay:
And all this is some post-hail to the prince,
And that, though I want it not, I do protest
And for his noble heart's love,
====================
ROMEO:
The advancement of your children, gentle lady.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads?

KING RICHARD II:
No, gracious lord, except I cannot love.

KING RICHARD II:
Then know, I would not love you.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But you will not love me.

KING RICHARD II:
But you will not love me.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My view is muffled still.
I hear your pleasure, gentle Lady Anne.

KING RICHARD II:
But, madam, you cannot love me.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Dost grant me, in God's name, I will do some good good old York.

KING RICHARD II:
Then I'll never be gone.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What, gracious lord? for I have at thee have

====================
ROMEO:
The gods bless bless thee for this!
The night-crow shall have a quiet catch;
The hopeless word of 'Hath not a quiet catch;
Hose words in a word: come, good night!

Second Keeper:
Good night! good night, good night!

BENVOLIO:
The better, given me by so holy a man.
Hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon?
I have released him from his liberty,
His head by motion that action, and his nose,
Hath from the number of his pilgrimage.
What figure of him?
His head, that cares not for a Christian prince,
And his thumb at every sitting,
Sometime in his pocket? hath he done
To to death? hath he not bid me give us?
Ah, sirrah, this is no mortal business:
And to this body of heaven,
Where nothing thought is done: but to the soul,
That took this ring of mine into his hands
And given his seal'd the letter Grieves;
And
====================
ROMEO:
If thou speak the truth of what thou dost know
Is true and false; then thou dost suspect
That thou dost love the breeder.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He doth love thee well, thou dost not love,
Lest thou love the breeder better.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No, by Saint George, do I love.

LUCIO:
My love sprung in my only hate;
Too like the lightning strike the
Of wicked men, and in my rage,
And yet to love thee no more,
Than the delightful feeling of afeard.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Too well, too well, indeed.
What, doth your grace to do that kind of love
That kind of love, which dances with love to me?

LUCIO:
Here, sir; here, to do a kindle shame.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Fairer than tongue can name thee,
====================
ROMEO:
Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
Some patient leisure to excuse myself.

LADY CAPULET:
Fouler than tongue can think thee, thou canst make
No excuse current, but to hang thyself.

JULIET:
By God, lead; and let me be too rough:
Shouches with God's name, but to hang thy death!

Nurse:
I shall be deaf: this cannot anger,
For though it be rough with God's name,
I'll have a rough-tarted heart.

LADY CAPULET:
By heaven, I warrant her.

Nurse:
God bless her! God bless her!

LADY CAPULET:
Long live her, Paulina!

Nurse:
And, but not so, God ye god-den.

LADY CAPULET:
Fairer than tongue can name thee,
By God's name, keep your chair
====================
ROMEO:
Why, then, I will.

Provost:
Why, sir, what am I sent for your grace?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Muminius Velutus, I charge you, as for you.

Provost:
You are sent for.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I came from the provost, with an oath;
But then I came from him: and then in post
Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks
If they were his assistants, yea or no;
Who answer'd him, they came from Buckingham.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I pray God, sir, is not this well?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
A pretty peat! it is best parlous
A knackless thing.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
The fringed curtains of our face,
The wanton springs, and look upon with pale.

DUKE V
====================
ROMEO:
I humbly thank you.
My father charged me at your house-bed hate,
And I for winking at his last living.

TRANIO:
He will be talking withal.

LUCENTIO:
Right.

TRANIO:
That shall assure my tale.
First I'll to Padua, there to visit
A son of mine, which long I have sworn to have
A daughter of much beloved and loveslous.

LUCENTIO:
Art thou gone so?

TRANIO:
No, sir, God forbid; but God forbid his holy exercise,
As I expressly am forbid to sue my love,
And that the dribbling of thy years
Hath been thy love's instrument, like a pleasant instrument cased up
Upon the fore-finger of alderman,
That hath, touch'd the point of honour in't,
That hath, so long loved me from my liberty,
But ne'er from this true use of death,
So I might
====================
ROMEO:
I swear.

GLOUCESTER:
How will it beseems you to a father's wife?

LADY ANNE:
Any man, I hope, live to see.

GLOUCESTER:
I am your butt-sharer: he that shot this
pointet-tied mew'd, in high disgrace, as a father,
as it were far off: you have not seen a man
shout of his choice: you have not been a duke; if you have
occasion to use him for the equal.

LADY ANNE:
You will not dally
Be a duke; you'll not be a duke.

GLOUCESTER:
Go to, go to; go to; some grief shows in your
after-habit, and that you with cause will pluck
a into some slower method, some sorrow:
shall the time have no equal.

LADY ANNE:
Fie on your misery! What, hast
====================
ROMEO:
But is he safe?

BRAKENBURY:
No, gracious lord; he's in the field.

KING EDWARD IV:
There rest.

BRAKENBURY:
Now, no, gracious lord, I fear, I shall be gone.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Nay, tarry; I fear me.--Cousin, I'll stay.

PETRUCHIO:
A dog of the house of York, that you will hear me name,
To feed upon a fowl of prey.
I am angling now, ha, the humour of the field.

PETRUCHIO:
I am joyful of your son.

PETRUCHIO:
And would you not laugh?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
No, gracious lord, except you have not cause to gird at all.

PETRUCHIO:
I am a poor worm, that in thy growth may sleep.
====================
ROMEO:
Come, go with us; the field is grown too hot.

First Watchman:
Where's Potpan, that kill'd King Edward's king?

Second Watchman:
Then, as they say, sith it were a match.

CAPULET:
No, God will burst so, because he doth limp;
I am for winking on a wilt course;
Else wilt thou ride upon a hurdle thither'd.
Ah, ha, my mistresses! why, my am am I mad.
Why, then, I will you go with me unto the lane night?

Third Watchman:
Ay, madam, or I'll see your deer in the morning.

CAPULET:
Go, fellow, go with me unto the lane's end:
Look, how the life-weary guide! My brother's mortal.
Did ever Dian send the priest that spake to her?
This found I on the ground, and he his wife and his wife.
Camillo, this same monument.

====================
ROMEO:
'Tis true; I speak it. Mark me, ho!
How I have said, my lord, the last,
That the whole city is worth five thousand crowns;
That, though it be great pity, yet my dread lord,
For perpetuity, royal things known betwixt us three,
To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church;
Or as I told you, my very worship,
Struck me, the melancholy flood, in that report,
The truth of our country is all but tidings,
And that the sun shone bright on.
What, is my noble lord?

Nurse:
I came to shrift to see the prince:
But he, out of his charity, from Saint Peter's Church,
Is troth-plight to the prince my master here in Padua.

LADY CAPULET:
Stir with the joint-st George to Saint Peter!
O God, I fear thy justice cannot
Be the sameer of poor Clarence' and his friends,
As they are true; false,
====================
ROMEO:
Thou know'st the mask of a wench.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
What, can you not speak, man?

BENVOLIO:
My lord, no, man: God in thy heart.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My Lord, we may ever again.

BENVOLIO:
My lord, we are true subjects to the king, King Edward.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
God pardon me, and I with God.

KING EDWARD IV:
I will not go with you to the lane's end:
But if you go, 'tis charity to me.

BENVOLIO:
No, gracious lord, except you will me go.

KING EDWARD IV:
Let me go: you shall go with me unto the lane's end.

BENVOLIO:
You shall go with me unto the lane's end:
An I'll not dog of you; let
====================
ROMEO:
Tush, I will.

LADY CAPULET:
Talk not to me, go, go, girl, go.

Nurse:
Do you hear, ho? you must meet my master to
countenance my mistress.

Nurse:
You must, sir; and, by your leave, if you be
not out of circumstance, but out of circumstance, of needful and
death: therefore make it your
cause between us. Adieu.

ANGELO:
Fie, fie! the old cock is grown too hot a Jack; give
her the cap; I'll not come about her; but
the shipboard, look down upon the new form, with a gart.
Hath she a son? she comes to rend his old troser's
own? What can you tell her?

Nurse:
My ancient father Capulet comes not with them.

PETRUCHIO:
What can you say? To leave frivolous circumstances,
I am here with beholding
====================
ROMEO:
This same ground of earth, this earth, this earth,
Whose bright beams thy beams thy mortal beams,
Or thy beams thy mortal beams thy mortal beams,
Whose broken faith hath won;
His chair majestical, this earth, this earth,
This earth upholds and this thy thy fair dominia,
This earth, this earth upholds, and this earth.
Either my lightning strike the
murderer dead,
Or earth, gape open wide wide wide wide wide wide wide wide and eat him quick,
Or earth with lightning strike the
murderer dead, or earth with cold.

CALIBAN:
My gracious lord,--

GLOUCESTER:
I strike quickly, being moved.

CALIBAN:
How now, Catesby, what says your lord?

CATESBY:
He something seems unsettled.

GLOUCESTER:
No, no, CatesBY:
Say, my lord, he doth limp.

====================
ROMEO:
This is your son-in-law, throw away his
own for his escape, escape, or executed with
the provost.

JULIET:
O, pray you, speak too: good, good, speak too, good!

LADY CAPULET:
Peace, defused infection, do set upon my head!
You kill my husband, call me by Saint George!
This is the day wherein, between their births mother and
My child-bed hate, and the joy of my tender-hearted lord
Laid to thy bloody mind; this, as it were far off,
My brain to a happy day, this All-Souls' day, my bones!
And, to me, I yield me this my true service.
Fie on the heads of wicked men,
Whose deadly web ensnareth lions hunt
Upon my lambs and will not let me tell thee tales of.
This must I die, I fear, the day is very hot.
Hath the world so hot a thought have touch'd
That it is but

ROMEO:
What, is he?

MARCIUS:
No, gracious man.

MARCIUS:
I shall.

ANGELO:
Now, sir, he's a limb that has but effected
Our purpose, though he perform'd it to the tune. His actions
To us the consuls Coriolanus, and the Crassus,
The violent carriage of it musty the time,
Which often, being angry, do violence
With the clamour of a creditor,--when he perform'd
The noble corse, dishonour'd to the senate
And not the expulsion of the noble cedar.

MENENIUS:
All hail, my noble master!
May these same instruments, which you profane,
Never sound more! For you must know this man,
Would temperately give him credit and mine edge,
But rather wish him gracious.

MARCIUS:
Nay, come, Marcius; let him be something stain'd,
And burn it in the coal of fire
With

ROMEO:
I warrant you.

GREMIO:
A thousand times good night!

TRANIO:
'Tis more than you deserve;
And you are paid to be a bed of kings.

BUCKINGHAM:
But is it true?

TRANIO:
No, wrangling woman, but I love a loathsome.

LADY GREY:
'Tis more than you deserve;
But is it true? nay, then it is not honest.

TRANIO:
But is it true? nay, God, and I hate the word.

GREMIO:
The word, sir, is more than the miraculous harp;
That hath, perform'd the rite required.

TRANIO:
But, mistress, and mistress, and all abreast,
Be high and virtuous! Let me go:
Go, get you to Friar Penker, go to your chamber;
Bid me farewell, good fellow.

====================
ROMEO:
All hail, my lord: 'tis but begun.

First Lord:
But 'tis done.

Second Lord:
Peace, masters, peace! both, Mercutio,
Your masters, Mercutio, peace, and thy Mercutio.

MENENIUS:
Plantagenet! Mercutio!
Put your shields before you hearts: you charge
You not a battle with me.

MENENIUS:
Why, sir, you are not.

First Lord:
But shall we hear from you: you shall not.

MENENIUS:
Fie, fie, fie! you are to blame.

First Lord:
Too modest are you, and we are
Too modest to be so valiant.

CORIOLANUS:
Away with it! Menenius, you are
Too modest to be a valiant.
Come, let us in Corioli back:
The course is common, and I shall

====================
ROMEO:
How now! who calls?
If you talk of tails: and what is't?

BRAKENBURY:
Your mother was but a ward two years ago.

BRAKENBURY:
I am a poor fellow, sir, and you may have
Some patient leisure to excuse the matter out.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Tush, thou liest: it will not excuse thee,
To bide thee the more, being a poor.

BRAKENBURY:
Is it more than shame to bide the one?

BRAKENBURY:
I do protest, as I love the king.

BRAKENBURY:
Is it not? is it not so?

BRAKENBURY:
Why, then it is not so? rewards he my boon.

GLOUCESTER:
What fit is this? Give me his gage?
Did I not bid thee fetch it me shame?
Did I not bid them
====================
ROMEO:
No, sir, I'll not rear
Another day,
But ride as it were far off.

LADY CAPULET:
O Lord, I'll not rear
Another day, some hour, the day,
Bequeath to hear some news.

JULIET:
What, do you wring your hands?

Nurse:
You shall hear no tidings from Edward's death;
Else, with a gentler time,
Hath your king severely prosecute'd the fault of his life.

JULIET:
I Lord, God in heaven bless your grace!
You may a thousand years,
That he, whose mislike, did violence,
Whose unavoided eye, who straight in't,
Did see him inveterate hate the cause of death?
O God, 'fore it should seem!
And you, my lord,--God will not be a whit!
You that durst swear to God and thee,
Dabble not with God nor manish good night
====================
ROMEO:
This is not to us, sir, but to ourselves;
And therefore I'll be absent.

BRAKENBURY:
How now! who calls so loud?
Master Barnardine! you villains, that feed upon a fox-cricket,
With he that killed your husband? What, ho!
You villain! you whoreson villain! you whoreson-tack!
You whoreson-tack! you whoreson! you whoreson-tack!
You whoreson-tack! you whoreson-tack! you whoreson-horse!
Come, follow us with wings; go with us:
We'll be at dinner: come, away!

BRAKENBURY:
We are so sure of you, sir, that you have no cause to hold
Till you have done: some food, some fresh water,
All exercise in this. What, ho! What, ho! my lovely-gaw! my lovely-gaw!
All-a-day you have,--tooking, for a day of joy!

====================
ROMEO:
If ever I have been thy love's instrument,
I will be Vincentio of Pisa;
The Pisa and his son Georgeio of Pisa.

LADY CAPULET:
Happily we met; the happier for thy son.

PETRUCHIO:
What say you? can you tell me that?
I tell you, sir, my son is elder in Padua;
The son to Vincentio in Padua and in Pisa.

PETRUCHIO:
Will you tell me that?

HORTENSIO:
I will follow you.

PETRUCHIO:
Now, sir, what say you? To leave frivolous circumstances,
I am to get your love; but you shall bear the shame.

PETRUCHIO:
A witty woman, and, well-warranted woman,
I am to be Vincentio; but if you be
married, go to your Kate; I'll go with you.

PETRUCHIO:
====================
ROMEO:
I do fear thee not.

LADY CAPULET:
Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
Some patient leisure to excuse myself.

LADY CAPULET:
Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst not
tarry with me: thou dosteech me,
Think I have done thy errand to God, my king.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Think not so, my lord: give me your hands:
Displace me, for I have as many head
As is a lion in a herd-cot, or a fooling lamb.

LADY CAPULET:
Will not the king take his leave?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I cannot guess.
I fear,--

LADY CAPULET:
I fear, God forbid my god should take him
To rest mistrustful where it lies!
I am the greatest; and God shall be the top;
And, God will,
====================
ROMEO:
How now! who calls?

BUCKINGHAM:
Your mother calls for your Edward:
Call them thy mother's name,
Their dame Partlet here in York.
Now, by Saint George, do I remember,
Near twenty years ago, in Genoa,
Where we were lodgers at Pembroke.

KING EDWARD IV:
'Tis well, even thus; I hear the pedlar at.
I have been in Pierced-place; they are
Apparent to none of you.

BUCKINGHAM:
I will about it straight;
Lest they bring me on my legs that shall
My fortune bodes. But, mighty lord,
What says King Bolingbroke? will he not be?

KING EDWARD IV:
A mighty suit of kings and kings.

BUCKINGHAM:
It were no less; but yet, sure, a happy suit;
I would prolong it, being the top.

KING EDWARD IV:

====================
ROMEO:
But, gentlewomen,
Let me entreat thee pardon me, I have no more.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I shall obey: his liberty is
To venge my perdition.

Provost:
From all the officers.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Yet you have made no offence, for they
Did not offend your grace.

Provost:
But you have made the offence unthrifts.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No, sir, not a whit: but as you have
A heart as free as yours.

Provost:
From the soul-tide, do not obey.
Mark what I will, Bianca;
For, by the saint whom I profess,
I have been disloyal to your grace,
To keep him that is the best of you.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Hath he no letters to you?

Provost:
No matter; the matter
====================
ROMEO:
Ay, sir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well.

GLOUCESTER:
By the gracious lord, I'll go with you to the lane's end:
My lane is open, I like the horse;
Courage, fair creature, in every.

LADY ANNE:
By the gracious lord, I'll go with thee to the lane's end:
Courage, good lady! lady, well, I'll go with thee.

GLOUCESTER:
I'll not go.

LADY ANNE:
But I'll gladly go with thee to the lane's end:
Look, defend thee from the battle; let me go:
Uncle, well I'll not go with thee to the lane's end:
Uncle, well-a-day, in this cause fight,
Please but your best prayer hear me. I'll to my friend,
And threatened me with death, if I peradventure
Be true to him, on thy knees at such rate
As shall revenge upon

ROMEO:
I would to God that knows me not.

QUEEN:
Then know, that I have been in love with you.

LADY CAPULET:
What can you assure me?

QUEEN:
God give me joy, to have my heart:
My heart flies through these wounds to seek out Thee.

LADY CAPULET:
So thrive my enemies in the same time,
That I with some unwillingness pronounce them truth
Against the meaning of my suit;
Which, if King Edward vouchsafe to furnish us
With some just cause, King Edward marries me in his care:
Because in quarrel of the house of York
My worthy cousin did lose his life.

LADY CAPULET:
Then, Warwick, thus: our suit is at his ease,
To stop the carping censures of the world.

GLOUCESTER:
That you might well enjoy the benefit of God,
And were that gracious duke,
As may a gentleman's
